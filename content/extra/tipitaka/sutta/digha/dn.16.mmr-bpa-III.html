<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 187. Then, after staying at Bhanda village as
long as he wished, the Bhagava said to the Venerable Ananda, <i><font color="#800040">"Come, Ananda, let us go to Hatthi village, and to Amba
village, and to Jambu village, and thence to the town of
Bhoga."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Venerable Ananda respectfully assented,
saying <font color="#800000">"Very well, Venerable Sir."</font> And
the Bhagava, together with a large company of bhikkhus, reached the town of
Bhoga. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bhagava stayed at the Ananda shrine at
that Bhoga town. While there, the Bhagava said to the bhikkhus,<i><font color="#800040"> "O Bhikkhus, I shall give a discourse on the four Great
Authorities<sup>1</sup>. Listen to the discourse and bear it well in mind. I
shall speak."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bhikkhus respectfully assenting, the
Bhagava gave this discourse:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 188. O Bhikkhus, in this (matter), if a
bhikkhu should say thus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><font color="#800040"> "Sirs, I have
heard and received this (exposition) from the mouth of the Bhagava: Such and
such is the Doctrine; such and such is the Vinaya, Instructions on methods of

Buddha's) Teaching."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> O Bhikkhus, the

the Bhagava; it is only an utterance wrongly learnt by the bhikkhu.' And, thus
(coming to this conclusion), bhikkhus, the assertion should be
rejected.</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> If, (however), on

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> O bhikkhus, remember
these four (citations of) Great Authorities, Mahapadesa.</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Bhagava was sojourning at the
Ananda shrine in the town of Bhoga, there, too, he repeatedly expounded to the
bhikkhus this very discourse:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><font color="#800040"> "Such is sila,
morality; such is samadhi, concentration of mind; such is panna, wisdom.
Samadhi, when based upon sila, is rich in result and of great effect. Panna,
when based upon samadhi, is rich in result and of great effect. The mind, when
developed through panna, is thoroughly liberated from the asavas, taints,
namely, kamasava, the taint of sensuous desire, bhavasava, the taint of
hankering after repeated existence, and avijjasava, the taint of ignorance of
the true nature of existence as set out in the Four Noble
Truths."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Great Authorities: <i>Mahapadesa: </i>The
whole term may be paraphrased as directives for deciding on statements
attributed to the Buddha, or to the other three Authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The Vinaya: This explanation is according
to the Commentary, commenting on this para 188.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The Sutta: According to the Commentary,
this term in this para 188 means the entire Teaching of the Buddha,
encompassing the three Pitakas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Fundamental Precepts: <i>Matika,
</i>(lit., contents), here means Fundamental Precepts for bhikkhus and
bhikkhunis.</p>

as long as he wished the Bhagava said to the Venerable Ananda, <i><font color="#800040">"Come Ananda, let us go to Pava."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Venerable Ananda respectfully assented,
saying, <font color="#800000">"Very well, Venerable Sir."</font> And
the Bhagava, together with a large company of bhikkhus, went to Pava and stayed
at the mango grove of Cunda, the goldsmith's son.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Cunda, the goldsmith's son heard that
the Bhagava had arrived at Pava and was staying at his mango grove, he went to
the Bhagava, and making obeisance, sat at a certain place. To Cunda, thus
seated, the Bhagava gave a discourse, and by his discourse caused him to
realize (the benefits of) the Teaching, to become established in (the
observance of) the Teaching, and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm for
(the practice of) the Teaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Bhagava had caused him to realize
(the benefits of) the Teaching, to become established in (the observance of)
the Teaching, and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm for (the practice
of ) the Teaching, Cunda, the goldsmith's son said to the Bhagava,
<font color="#0000ff">"Venerable Sir, may it please the Bhagava to accept
my offering of food for tomorrow, together with the company of
bhikkhus."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bhagava, by silence, signified his
acceptance. And Cunda, the goldsmith's son, knowing that the Bhagava had
accepted his request, rose from his seat, made obeisance to the Bhagava, and
left respectfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Cunda, the goldsmith's son, after that
night had passed, caused choice food of both hard and soft kinds, as well as
quantities of tender pork,* to be prepared at his house, and then informed the
Bhagava that it was time for the meal by the message<font color="#0000ff">
"Venerable Sir, it is time (to proceed), the food-offering is
ready."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in the morning the Bhagava got ready by
rearranging his robes and taking alms-bowl and great robe went to the house of
Cunda, the goldsmith's son, accompany by the company of bhikkhus, and (on
arriving there) took the seat prepared for him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having thus seated himself, the Bhagava said
to Cunda, the goldsmith's son, <i><font color="#800040">"Cunda, (you may)
serve me the sukara-maddava prepared by you, and (you may) serve the other food
prepared by you to the company of bhikkhus."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cunda, the goldsmith's son assented
respectfully, and accordingly served the prepared <i>sukara-maddava </i>to the
Bhagava and the other prepared food to the company of bhikkhus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Bhagava said to Cunda, the
goldsmith's son, <i><font color="#800040">"Cunda, bury the remaining
sukara-maddava in a pit. Cunda, apart from the Tathagata himself, I see no one
either in the celestial world of devas, Mara or Brahmas, or in the human world
of samanas(recluses), brahmanas (those leading a religious life), rulers and
men, who, eating this sukara-maddava, can digest it well."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cunda the goldsmith's son assented
respectfully, saying "<font color="#0000ff">Very well, Venerable
Sir</font>," and buried the remaining <i>sukara-maddava </i>in a pit. Then
he approached the Bhagava, made obeisance to him, and seated himself at a
certain place. And the Bhagava, by religious discourse to Cunda seated on one
side, caused him to realize (the benefits of) the Teaching, to become
established in (the observance of) the Teaching, and to be filled with gladness
and enthusiasm for (the practice of) the Teaching. Then the Bhagava rose from
his seat and departed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 190. Later, after the Bhagava had eaten the
food offered by Cunda, the goldsmith's son, a severe illness came upon the
Bhagava, a severe attack of dysentery with discharge of blood, and he suffered
excessive pain near unto death. This the Bhagava endured with mindfulness and
deliberation, and without being perturbed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Bhagava said to the Venerable
Ananda,<i><font color="#800040"> "Come Ananda, let us go to
Kusinara."</font></i> The Venerable Ananda assented respectfully, saying
<font color="#800000">"Very well, Venerable Sir."</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#0000ff" size="+1">Separate Verses</font>**</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard that after partaking of the food
offered by Cunda the goldsmith's son, the Enlightened One suffered severe
illness and pain, near unto death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After having eaten the tender pork, there
arose in the Teacher excessive pain and illness. Suffering (the attack of)
dysentery, the Bhagava said,<i><font color="#800040"> 'I shall go to the town
of Kusinara.'</font></i></p>
<p align="center"><a name="29"></a><font color="#0000ff" size="+3">Having
Drinking Water Brought </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 191. Then the Bhagava left the road and went
to the foot of a tree. And he said to the Venerable Ananda,<i><font color="#800040"> "Ananda, fold my double-layered robe fourfold and place
it on the ground. I am exhausted; I shall sit down."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Venerable Ananda said,<font color="#800000">"Very well,Venerable Sir,"</font> and folding the
(Bhagavas) double-layered robe in four, placed it on the ground. The Bhagava
sat down on the folded robe laid on the ground and said, <i><font color="#800040">"Ananda, go and bring drinking water. I am thirsty. I want
to have a drink of water."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this being said (by the Bhagava), the
Venerable Ananda said to the Bhagava,<font color="#800000"> "Venerable
Sir, five hundred carts have just now crossed the stream. The shallow water,
being stirred up by the cartwheels, flows turbid and muddy. Venerable Sir, the
Kakudha river is not far off. There, the water is clear, sweet, cool, and free
from muddiness. There are good banks (i.e., making the river accessible), and
it is a pleasant place. At the Kakudha river the Bhagava may drink water, and
also may refresh himself."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bhagava said a second time, <i><font color="#800040">"Ananda, go and bring drinking water. I am thirsty. I want
to have a drink of water."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a second time, too, Ananda said to the
Bhagava,<font color="#800000"> "Venerable Sir, five hundred carts have
just now crossed the stream. The shallow water, being stirred up by the cart
wheels, flows turbid and muddy. Venerable Sit, the Kakudha river is not far
off. There, the water is clear, sweet, cool, and free from muddiness. There are
good banks (i.e.,making the river accessible), and it is a pleasant place. At
the Kakudha river the Bhagava may drink water, and also may refresh
himself."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bhagava said a third time, <i><font color="#800040">"Ananda,
(I exhort you to) go and bring drinking water. I am thirsty. I want to have a
drink of water."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ananda, saying <font color="#800000">"Very well, Venerable Sir," </font>assented
respectfully, and taking the alms-bowl, went to the stream. Then, the shallow
water which was flowing turbid and muddy, having been stirred up by the
cartwheels, became clear, pure and absolutely free from muddiness. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this thought occurred to the Venerable
Ananda:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800000"> "Wonderful indeed,
Sirs, and marvellous indeed, Sirs, is the great power and supernormal (psychic)
potency of the Tathagata! This shallow stream, which was flowing turbid and
muddy, having been stirred up by the wheels of the crossing carts, is on my
appearance flowing clear, pure and absolutely free from muddiness."</font>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carrying the drinking water in the alms-bowl,
the Venerable Ananda went back to the Bhagava, and said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800000"> "Indeed wonderful,
Venerable Sir, indeed marvellous, Venerable Sir, is the great power and
supernormal (psychic) potency of the Tathagata! That shallow water of the
stream, which was flowing turbid and muddy having been stirred up just now by
the wheels of the crossing carts, became on my approach clear, pure an
absolutely free from muddiness. Now let the Bhagava drink the water. Let the
Sugata drink the water."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Bhagava drank the water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * tender pork: <i>Sukara-maddava: sukara=pig,
maddava=soft, </i>tender, delicate. The Commentary gives two variant
interpretations: (i) soft rice boiled with five differently tasting kinds of
cow's milk; or (ii) food prepared with <i>rasayana. (Rasayana </i>may mean an
elixir or delicate essence extracted from the roots, leaves, flowers, etc., of
a plant.) The Venerable Dhammapala, in the Udana Commentary, also has
"young bamboo shoots liked by pigs". Other interpretations, based on
analogical formations, are "truffles, mushrooms, yams" i.e., the kind
of food enjoyed by wild pigs or boars.</p>

the Theras, bhikkhu elders, at the Council.</p>

concerning Pukkusa the Malla Prince</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 192. At that time, Pukkusa, a Malla
prince<sup>1</sup>, wh was a disciple of Alara Kalama (i.e., Alara of the
Kalama clan,) was on a long journey from Kusinara to Pava. Seeing the Bhagava
sitting at the foot of tree, Pukkusa of the Mallas approached the Bhagava made
obeisance to him, and having sat down on one side, said to the Bhagava thus: 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wonderful it is, Venerable Sir,
marvellous it is Venerable Sir, (how) the pabbajitas<sup>2 </sup>remain abiding
it the attainment of calm.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Venerable Sir, it happened formerly
that Alara Kalama, while on a long journey, left the road and sat down at the
foot of a tree by the roadside, to spend the day. Venerable Sir, at that time,
five hundred carts passed by very close to Alara Kalama."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Venerable Sir, a certain man who had
been following behind those five hundred carts, went up to where Alara Kalama
was and asked him 'Sir, did you see five hundred carts pass by?'"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Friend, I did not see them.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, how is it, then? Did you hear the noise
(of those carts)?'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, how is it, then? Were you asleep?'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Friend, I was not asleep, either.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, how is it then? Were you conscious?' 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes, friend, (I was conscious).'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Sir, you say you did not see and did not
hear the five hundred carts which passed close by you, even though you were
conscious and awake. Yet, isn't your double-layered robe covered all over with
dust (from the passing of the carts)?' </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is so, friend.' </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Venerable Sir, then that man thought
thus: 'Wonderful it is, Sirs, marvellous it is, Sirs, the state of calm in
which the pabbajitas remain abiding! This ascetic Alara, although conscious and
awake, did not see, did not hear, the five hundred carts which passed close by
(him)!' And expressing his feeling of deep reverence for Alara Kalama, he
departed."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 193. (The Bhagava said:) <i><font color="#800040">Pukkusa, what do you think of this? Which is the more difficult
to achieve (lit., do), the more difficult to happen, (of the case of two
persons,) (the condition of) one who, though conscious and awake, does not see
and does not hear the five hundred carts which pass close by (him), or (the
condition of) the the other who, though conscious and awake, does not see and
does not hear heavy rain, rumbling thunder, flashing lightning and crashing
thunderbolts (close by him)?</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800000"> "Venerable Sir, it
cannot be said that remaining without seeing and hearing the carts passing
close by— whether it be five hundred, six hundred, seven hundred, eight
hundred, nine hundred, a thousand or even a hundred thousand carts—is
difficult<sup>4</sup>, indeed, it is much more difficult to remain without
seeing and hearing heavy rain, rumbling thunder, flashing lightning and
crashing thunderbolts (close by). It is more difficult to do, more difficult to
happen.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> Pukkusa, at one time
I was staying in a straw hut at Atuma (town). At that time, there was heavy
rain, with rumbling thunder and flashes of lightning, and a thunderbolt struck
not far from my hut, killing two cultivators, who were brothers, and four oxen.
Then, Pukkusa, a multitude of people came out from Atuma (town)and went up to
the place where the two cultivator brothers and four oxen had been
killed.</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> Pukkusa, by that
time, I had come out of the straw hut and was walking up and down in the open,
near the door of the straw hut. Then, Pukkusa, a man from that crowd of people
approached me, and making obeisance to me, stood at a certain place. Pukkusa, I
asked that man, 'Friend, why are these many people gathered?'</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff"> 'Venerable Sir, just
now two cultivators, who were brothers, and four oxen have been struck and
killed by lightning while it was raining heavily, thunder was rolling and
lightning was flashing. That is why this multitude of people has gathered. But,
Venerable Sir, where were you?'</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> 'Friend, I have been
here all the while.'</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff"> 'Venerable Sir, how is
it, then? Did you see (the happening)?'</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> 'Friend, I did not
see it.'</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff"> 'Venerable Sir, how is
it, then? Did you hear the sound?'</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> 'Friend, I did not
hear the sound, either.'</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff"> 'Venerable Sir, how is
it, then? Were you asleep?'</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> 'Friend, I was not
asleep, either.'</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff"> 'Venerable Sir, how is
it, then? Were you conscious?'</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> 'Yes, friend, (I was
conscious).'</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff"> 'Venerable Sir, is it
that, though conscious and awake, you neither saw nor heard heavy rain,
rumbling thunder, flashing lightning and crashing thunder bolts?</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pukkusa, then this thought came to that man: 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">'Wonderful it is, Sirs,
marvellous it is, Sirs, the state of calm in which the pabbajitas remain
abiding! This pabbajita (i.e., the Buddha), although conscious and awake, did
not see, did not hear heavy rain, rumbling thunder, flashing lightning and
crashing thunderbolts'. </font>And expressing his feeling of deep reverence for
me, and making obeisance to me, departed respectfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this had been said, Pukkusa the Malla
prince said to the Bhagava: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">"Venerable Sir, the
deep reverence I felt for Alara Kalama, I now throw away (as if) scattering it
in a great wind, or (as if) letting it be carried away by a strong
current.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff"> "Venerable Sir,
extremely wonderful (is the Truth)! Surpassingly beautiful (is the Truth)!
Venerable Sir, just as if that which has been turned over is turned up right,
or that which has been hidden is revealed, or one who has lost his way is
informed of the right way, or an oil-lamp is (brought and) held in the darkness
so that those with eyes might see objects, even so the Bhagava has shown me the
Truth in many ways."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff"> "Venerable Sir, I
take refuge in the Bhagava, I take refuge in the Dhamma, (the Teaching of the
Buddha), I take refuge in the Samgha, the community of bhikkhus. May the
Bhagava accept me as a lay-disciple, one who has taken refuge, from this day to
the end of life." </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 194. Then, Pukkusa the Malla prince called a
man and said to him, <font color="#0000ff">"You<sup>5</sup>, do go and
bring the pair of fine golden-hued pieces of cloth of mine kept for special
occasions."</font> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man replied"Very well, Sir,"
and went and brought a pair of lengths of fine golden-hued cloth. Then Pukkusa
the Malla prince offered the ceremonial pieces of cloth to the Bhagava,
saying<font color="#0000ff"> "Venerable Sir, may the Bhagava accept, out
of compassion (for me), this pair of fine ceremonial lengths of
cloth."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bhagava said,<i><font color="#800040">
"In that case, present<sup>6 </sup>one to me and one to
Ananda."</font></i> Pukkusa the Malla prince said, <font color="#0000ff">"Very well,Venerable Sir," </font>and presented one
to the Bhagava, and the other (piece of cloth) to the Venerable Ananda. And
then the Bhagava, by religious discourse, caused Pukkusa the Malla prince to
realize (the advantages of) the Teaching, to become established in (the
observance of) the Teaching, and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm for
(the practice of) the Teaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, by the Bhagava's discourse, having been
caused to realize the advantages of the Teaching, to be come established in the
observance of the Teaching, and to be filled with gladness and enthusiasm for
the practice of the Teaching, Pukkusa the Malla prince arose from his seat,
made obeisance to the Bhagava. and departed respectfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 195. Then, not long after Pukkusa the Malla
prince had left, the Venerable Ananda placed and arranged the pair of fine,
golden-hued robes on the body of the Bhagava. When placed on the (brilliantly
shining) body of the Bhagava, those (golden-hued robes) appeared as though
faded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the Venerable Ananda said to the
Bhagava, <font color="#800000">"Most wonderful it is, Venerable Sir,
marvellous it is, Venerable Sir, how extremely clear and radiant the
Tathagata's complexion appears! When the pair of golden-hued robes were placed
on the Bhagava's body, they became as though faded."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> Ananda, it is so.
Ananda, it is so. There are two occasions on which the complexion of the
Tathagata appears extremely clear and radiant. </i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> What are these two
occasions?</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> The night, Ananda.
when the Tathagata attains unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment, and the night
when the Tathagata passes away, realizing parinibbana by experiencing the
ultimate peace of anupadisesa nibbana, the complete cessation of all the five
khandhas.</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> Ananda, these are
the two occasions on which the complexion of the Tathagata appears exceedingly
clear and radiant.</i></font> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> And now today,
Ananda, In the last watch of this night, in the Sal grove of the Malla princes,
at the road-bend leading to Kusinara town, the Tathagata's realization of
parinibbana will take place between two Sal trees. Come, Ananda, let us go to
the Kakudha river.</i></font> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Venerable Ananda, saying
<font color="#800000">"Very well, Venerable Sir"</font> assented
respectfully.</p>
<p align="center"><font color="#0000ff" size="+1">Separate
Verse<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<blockquote> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pukkusa brought and offered (to
the Buddha) a pair of fine golden-hued robes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enrobed in them, the Teacher shone in golden
radiance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 196. Then the Bhagava went to the Kakudha
river with a great company of bhikkhus, and went down to the river. He bathed,
and drank water. Then he came onto the bank again, and went to the mango grove.
He said to the Venerable Cundaka, <i><font color="#800040">"Cundaka, fold
my double-layered robe in four, and place it on the ground. I am weary,
Cundaka. I shall lie down."</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Venerable Cundaka assented respectfully,
and placed the folded double-layered robe on the ground. Then the Bhagava lay
down on his right side, nobly (like a lion), placing the left foot over and a
little beyond the right foot, with mindfulness and deliberation, and keeeping a
predetermined time of arising in his mind. The Venerable Cundaka sat there in
front of the Bhagava. </p>
<p align="center"><font color="#0000ff" size="+1">Separate
Verses<sup>8</sup></font></p>
<blockquote> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being very weary<sup>9</sup>,
the Buddha (the Enlightened), the Incomparable in the world, the Great Teacher,
the Tathagata, went to the Kakudha river where the water was clear, sweet and
clean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having come out of the river, after bathing
and drinking watar, the Bhagava, the Great Teacher, the Highest, who launched
and expounded the Truths (of the Teaching), went to the mango grove, surrounded
by and in the midst of the entire group of bhikkhus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There the Buddha said to the bhikkhu called
Cundaka, <i><font color="#800040">'Fold my double-layered robe fourfold and lay
it down; I shall lie down.'</font></i> Thus asked by the Buddha, Cundaka folded
the double-layered robe in four and quickly placed it on the ground. The great
Teacher, feeling tired, lay down. Cundaka also sat in front of the Buddha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 197. Then the Bhagava. said to the Venerable
Ananda:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font color="#800040">Ananda, someone
might cause remorse or regret to Cunda, the goldsmith's son by saying
"Friend Cunda, the Tathagata passed away after eating your food last.
Therefore, it is loss and misfortune to you." If that happens, Ananda, the
remorse or regret Cunda might feel should thus be countered: "Friend
Cunda, the Tathagata passed away after eating your food last. Therefore, it is
good fortune and good gain to you. Friend Cunda, I heard and received these
words from the Bhagava himself. There are two offerings of food which are of
equal fruition and of equal result and which are of much greater fruition and
much greater benefit than any other offering of food. What are these two
offerings of food?"</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800040"><i>"The offering
of food, after eating which the Tathagata attains unsurpassed. Perfect
Self-Enlightenment. (This is one.)"</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800040"><i>"The offering
of food, after eating which the Tathagata passes into the ultimate peace of
anupadisesa nibbana which is the complete cessation of all the five khandhas.
(This is the other.)</i></font> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800040"><i>"These are the
two offerings of food which are of equal fruition and equal result and which
are of much greater fruition and much greater benefit than any other offering
of food. (Therefore) Respected<sup>10</sup> Cunda, the goldsmith's son has
accumulated that <i>kamma </i>(force of action) which will bring about long
life, which will bring about beautiful appearance, which will bring about
well-being and happiness, which will bring about large retinues, which will
bring about rebirth in the realms of devas, and which will bring about
pre-eminence."</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font color="#800040">Thus, Ananda, the
remorse or regret of Cunda, the goldsmith's son should be dispelled.</font></i>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Bhagava, understanding this matter,
at that moment uttered this exultant verse:</p>
<blockquote> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> To him
who gives, merit accumulates.</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> In him who is
self-controlled, hostility cannot grow. </i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i>He who is endowed
with wisdom, casts off evil. </i></font> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i>He who thus casts off
evil, by the rooting out of passion, anger and mental bewilderment, attains
peace (through the extinction of the fires of kilesa, moral
defilements).</i></font></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Malla prince: </b><i>Mallaputta:
</i>lit., son of the Mallas. The Mallas were a clan of the ruling Khattiya
Class, and thus, princes. It is possible to render <i>mallaputta </i>as a Malla
youth, or a scion of the Malla prince clan or a young man of Malla lineage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <b>Pabbajita </b>means one who has gone
out from home, one who has given up worldly life and undertaken the life of a
bhikkhu, recluse or ascetic The term thus can indicate a disciple of the
Buddha, but here Alara a leading ascetic, was not such a disciple. Ascetics
also engaged in deep mental cultivation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>attainment of calm:</b> <i>Santa
</i>(instr., <i>santena) </i>tranquillity, calmness mind. <i>Vihara
</i>(instr., <i>viharena), </i>in this context, state, condition. It is
rendered in the Burmese version as <i>Samapatti, </i>sustained attainment of
deep mental absorption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. This sentence is as paraphrased in the
Burmese version. The Pali Text reads: "What can (lit., will) five hundred,
six hundred etc., carts do ?" That is, the effect of even large numbers of
carts will not be comparable to the effect of rain, lightning, thunder, etc. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. <b>You: </b><i>bhane, </i>a familiar term
used in addressing subordinates of inferiors, rendered here by "You,"
as "Friend," or "My good man" would not be appropriate in
tone.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. <b>present:</b> this follows
the rendering 'offer or donate' according to the Commentary. The term
<i>acchadehi </i>literally means "Cover, put (some thing) on (somebody or
something)."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.<b> Separate Verse: </b>inserted by the
Elders who collected the Dhamma (texts) at the First Council. (The Commentary)

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.<b> Separate Verses:</b> inserted by the
Elders at the First Council.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. <b>Being very weary:</b> The Pali Text
here has <i>akilantarupo, </i>which would mean 'as if not weary.' The reading,
as in the Udana Pali Text, <i>sukilantarupo, </i>'being very weary' would be
more consistent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. <b>Respected:</b> this is a paraphrase,
to fit in with the context, of <i>ayasma </i>(lit., long-living) in the Pali
Text, which is usually translated as Venerable, and which is usually used for
and to bhikkhus of standing.</p>

Many rich nobles, many rich brahmins, many rich householders who revere the
Tathagata dwell there. They will render due honour to the remains of the
Tathagata."</font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><font color="#800040"> Say not so, Ananda.

Righteous Ruler ruling by the principles of righteousness, Ruler over the four
quarters of the earth (lit., the four island-continents bounded by four
oceans), Conqueror of all enemies, whose realm was established in security, and
who was endowed with the Seven Treasures. And Ananda, this (Kusinara) town was
then King Mahasudassana's capital city, called Kusavati. From east to west it
was twelve yojanas long, and from north to south it was seven yojanas
broad.</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#800040"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ananda, the capital

crowded with (all kinds of) yakkha-devas, and abundant in provisions, so the
capital city Kusavati was opulent, prosperous, well-populated, crowded with
(all kinds of) people, and abundant in provisions. </i></font></p>
<p><font color="#800040"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ananda, the capital
city Kusavati was never silent by day and night. (resounding) with ten sounds,
namely, the noises of elephants, of horses, of carriages, the sounds of big
drums, of tabours, of lutes, of singing, of conches, of small gongs of cymbals,
and tenthly, cries of "Eat, drink chew."<sup>1</sup></i></font></p>

Kusinara were assembled at the council hall on certain business. Then the
Venerable Ananda approached the council hall of the Malla princes and announced
to them:</p>

Ananda, the Malla princes, their sons (and daughters), daughters-in-law, and
their wives felt miserably grief stricken, sad at heart, and oppressively
sorrowful in mind. Some wept with dishevelled hair, with upraised hands, they
flung themselves down, and rolled forward and backward, hither and thither;

stricken, sad at heart, and oppressively sorrowful in mind, approached the
Venerable Ananda, in the Sal grove of the Mallas at the road-bend (leading) to
the town. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then this thought occurred to the Venerable
Ananda:</p>

the Mallas of Kusinara pay homage to the Bhagava one by one, the night will
have passed into dawn before (all) the Malla princes finish paying reverence to
the Bhagava. It would be well if I should put the Mallas of Kusinara in
(separate) groups according to family, and let them pay homage group by group,

ascetic<sup>1</sup>, was staying at Kusinara. He heard that "On this day,
in the last watch of the night, the parinibbana of the Samana Gotama<sup>2
</sup> will take place." Then Subhadda the wandering ascetic had this
thought:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800000"> "I have heard it
said by old and venerable wandering ascetics, teachers of teachers, that the
Homage-worthy, Perfectly Self-Enlightened Tathagatas arise in the world only

the Samana Gotama will take place. There is an uncertainty (regarding true
doctrine) that has arisen in me. I have this faith in the Samana Gotama that he
will be able to expound the Doctrine to me so as to remove this
uncertainty."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Subhadda the wandering ascetic
approached the Venerable Ananda in the Sal grove of the Malla princes at the
road-bend (leading) to Kusinara, and said to the Venerable Ananda:<font color="#800000"> "O Ananda, I have heard it said by old and venerable
wandering ascetics, teachers of teachers, that the Homage-Worthy, Perfectly

Today, in the last watch of the night, the parinibbana of the Samana Gotama
will take place. There is an uncertainty that has arisen in me. I have this
faith in the Samana Gotama that he will be able to expound the Doctrine to me
so as to remove this uncertainty. O Ananda, I request (the chance of getting)
to see the Samana Gotama."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this being said, the Venerable Ananda
replied:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF8040"> "Friend Subhadda,
this cannot be allowed. (lit., enough, or, not fitting.) Do not harass the
Tathagata. The Bhagava is very tired."</font></p>

Do not harass the Tathagata. The Bhagava is very tired."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 213. The Bhagava overheard this conversation
between the Venerable Ananda and the wandering ascetic Subhadda, and the
Bhagava said to the Venerable Ananda:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><font color="#800040"> Ananda, it is not
fitting (to hinder the wandering ascetic). Do not prevent Subhadda (from seeing
me). Ananda, let Subhadda get (the opportunity) to see the Tathagata. If

and not because he wishes to harass me. When I answer what he asks, he will
readily understand that (answer).</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Venerable Ananda said to the
wandering ascetic Subhadda, <font color="#FF8040">"Go, Friend Subhadda.
The Bhagava has given you permission."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Subhadda the wandering ascetic
approached where the Bhagava was, and offered courteous greetings to the
Bhagava. After offering courteous greetings to the Bhagava, and having said
memorable words of felicitation, Subhadda seated himself on one side. When he
was seated, Subhadda the wandering ascetic addressed the Bhagava thus: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800000"> "O (Venerable)
Gotama, there are samanas and brahmanas (i.e., leaders in religious life) who
have communities of many disciples, who have large sects of followers, who are
leaders of (their) sects, who are renowned, who are famous, who are founders of
schools of doctrine, and who are well-esteemed by many people. They are,
namely, Purana Kasaapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana,
Sancaya Belathaputta, and Nigantha Nataputta. Do all of them have knowledge and
understanding, as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no
knowledge and understanding? Or do some of them have knowledge and
understanding, and some have, no knowledge and understanding ?"</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> Subhadda, do not ask
(this question) (lit., it is not fitting, not proper). Put aside that
(question) whether all of them have knowledge and understanding, as they
themselves have declared, or whether all of them have no knowledge and
understanding, or whether some of them have knowledge and understanding, and
some have no knowledge and understanding.</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> Subhadda, I shall
expound the Doctrine to you. Listen and bear it well in mind. I shall
speak.</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Subhadda the wandering ascetic assenting
respect fully by saying<font color="#800000"> "Very well, Venerable

Magga and Phala, a sotapanna), nor is there found a samana of the second stage,
(a realizer of the Second Magga and Phala, a sakadagami), nor is there found a
samana of the third stage, (a realizer of the Third Magga and Phala, an

(an anagami), and in it is found a samana of the fourth stage (an arahat).
</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> Now, Subhadda, in
this Teaching (of mine) there is to be found the Noble Path of Eight

sakadagami); in this Teaching alone is found a samana of the third stage (an
anagami); in this Teaching alone is found a samana of the fourth stage (an
arahat). Other systems of Teaching are void of (the twelve) <sup>3</sup> noble
samanas who have true knowledge. Subhadda, if these (twelve) bhikkhus practise
and pass on the Teaching rightly, the world will not be void of
arahats.</i></font></p>
<p align="CENTER"> (Verse)</p>
<blockquote><i><font color="#800040">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subhadda,
at the age of twenty-nine, I renounced the world and became an ascetic to
search for Enlightenment <i>(Sabbannuta Nana). </i>it is over fifty years now,
since I became an ascetic. Outside this (Teaching of mine) there is no one who
cultivates Insight Practice (vipassana) leading to <i>Magga Nana; </i>(outside
of this Teaching) there is no samana of the first stage <i>(sotapanna);
</i>neither is there a samana of the second stage; nor a samana of the third
stage; nor a samana of the fourth stage.</font></i></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#800040"><i> Other systems of
teaching are void of (the twelve) noble samanas who have true knowledge.
Subhadda, if these (twelve) bhikkhus practise and pass on the Teaching, the
world will not be void of arahats.</i></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 215. When this was said, Subhadda the
wandering ascetic addressed the Bhagava thus:<font color="#800000">
"Venerable Sir, extremely wonderful (is the Doctrine)! Venerable Sir,
surpassingly beautiful (is the Doctrine)! Venerable Sir, just as if that which
has been turned over is turned upright, or that which has been hidden is
revealed, or one who has lost his way is informed of the right way, or an
oil-lamp is (brought and) held in the darkness so that those with eyes might
see objects, even so the Bhagava has shown me the Truth in many ways. Venerable
Sir, I take refuge in the Bhagava, I take refuge in the Dhamma (the Teaching of
the Buddha), I take refuge in the Samgha (the Order of bhikkhus). May I,
Venerable Sir, receive from the Bhagava (lit., in the presence of' the Bhagava)
initiation and admission into the Order as a bhikkhu."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font color="#800040">Subhadda, if a
person who previously has been a believer in other Doctrines wishes to be
initiated and to be admitted into this Order as a bhikkhu, he has to live under
probation for four months. When the four months have passed, if the bhikkhus
are satisfied (with him), that person will be initiated and admitted into the
Order, thus becoming a bhikkhu. But in this matter, the individual differences
are recognized.</font></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800000">"Venerable Sir, if
a person, having been a believer in another Doctrine and wishing to receive
initiation and admission into this Order as a bhikkhu, has to live under
probation for four months, and if at the end of the four months, the bhikkhus
are satisfied and grant him initiation and grant him admission into the Order
as a bhikkhu, I am prepared to live under probation even for four years. At the
end of four years let the bhikkhus who are satisfied grant me initiation and
admission into the Order so as to become a bhikkhu."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Bhagava said to the Venerable
Ananda, <i><font color="#800040">"Since that is so, Ananda, let Subhadda
be initiated into the Order.</font></i>" And the Venerable Ananda replied,
<font color="#FF8040">"Very well, Venerable Sir."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Subhadda the wandering ascetic
said this to the Venerable Ananda:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800000">"Fortunate you all
are, Friend Ananda; good gain you all have, Friend Ananda, in that you all have
received in the very presence of the Teacher inauguration as close disciples in
this Teaching." </font>(lit., have been sprinkled over with the sprinkling
or anointing of close discipleship.) </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subhadda the wandering ascetic then received
initiation and admission into the Order as a bhikkhu in the presence of the
Bhagava. Not long after that, the Venerable Subhadda sought solitary seclusion
and remained directing his mind (towards the attainment of Nibbana) without any
remission of awareness and with vigorous resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And soon he attained to and remained abiding
in the supreme Arahatta Fruition stage, the goal of the Practice of Purity
<i>(brahmacariya), </i>having realized this in this very life, by himself and
through Magga Insight <i>(abhinna), </i>— (a desired goal) for which good
people worthily leave the worldly life and become homeless recluses. Thus he
knew<font color="#800000"> "Rebirth is no more (for me); I have achieved
the goal of the Practice of Purity; what should be done (for the realization of
Magga) has been done; and I have nothing more to do (for such
realization)."</font> The Venerable Subhadda became one of the arahats,
and he was the last one to become a disciple in the presence of the Bhagava.
