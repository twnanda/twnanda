		Just as a sweet-smelling and beautiful lotus<br>
		can grow from a pile of discarded waste,<br>
		the radiance of a true disciple of the Buddha<br>
		outshines dark shadows cast by ignorance.</i><br>
		<br>
		Dhammapada, verses 58 – 9<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Somebody has asked the question, ‘What is emotion?’ I can’t say I know 
		how to answer that question directly. I’m not even sure it would be very 
		useful to try and say what emotion is. It’s like asking, ‘What is 
		gravity?’ If we were to look in a physics textbook, we would find 
		detailed mathematical descriptions of how gravity works, but they still 
		don’t explain what the force of gravity actually is. It can be described 
		in terms of its effects, and accurate predictions can be made about how 
		it affects matter. Similarly, it might not be difficult to come up with 
		psychological or neurophysiological descriptions of emotional activity, 
		but I suggest that they probably wouldn’t be all that helpful. <br>
		<br>
		However, I’m pleased the question has been asked, since I’m sure most of 
		us have found out that we can’t really apply ourselves to the practice 
		of awareness without encountering strong emotions. We quite rightly feel 
		a need to understand this dimension of ourselves.<br>
		<br>
		A useful way to approach the understanding of emotions is by considering 
		not what they are but rather how we can discover an unobstructed 
		relationship with them. By that I mean how we can get to know ourselves 
		intimately; how we can learn by way of first-hand investigation to see 
		where and how it is we find ourselves blocked or obstructed in our 
		ability to receive emotion, our own or those of others. So I would 
		recommend instead of asking ‘what’ that we ask ‘how’. How does it feel, 
		to feel what we feel? How freely can we feel what we feel, when, for 
		instance, we feel regret or disappointment? Do we escape up into our 
		head and start analyzing ourselves, asking what is this regret, this 
		disappointment, trying to create an explanation?<br>
		<br>
		Related to this, a doctor friend who rings me from America from time to 
		time called earlier this evening and was sharing his understanding of 
		what he thinks is going on when Buddhists talk about transmigrating 
		through the various realms of existence. According to him, this talk is 
		about creating a mythology as a way of processing information that has 
		been stored up in the brain. He gave a very sophisticated description 
		that I confess I couldn’t really understand. But more important than my 
		limited ability to grasp his abstraction was that I didn’t get any sense 
		that this interpretation took him to a place of resolution. And surely 
		that is the point of our practice – to take us to an experience of 
		completeness.<br>
		<br>
		It is quite valid to interpret the traditional Buddhist depictions of 
		the Six Realms of Existence in terms of inner realities that we 
		experience here and now, not only as referring to possible past and 
		future lives. Yet we still have the task of finding out for ourselves 
		how to remain conscious and calm as we ascend to the heavens or descend 
		into hell realms. It is very easy to become attached to 
		intellectualisations as a way of avoiding a more direct apprehension of 
		ourselves. If we have a tendency to do this, we could be failing to make 
		use of the valuable opportunity to face our strong emotions and passions 
		in their raw reality. Unless we get to the root cause of our painful and 
		unpleasant feelings, we will become lost time and again in pleasure or 
		in pain, falling for their convincing appearance of permanence. 
		Ultimately we need access to much better-rooted resources than abstract 
		descriptions.<br>
		<br>
		One of the things that inhibit our turning directly to face ourselves in 
		the midst of emotional flare-ups is the fear that to do so will increase 
		the suffering. We might think that if we stop resisting the threatening 
		energy, it will take us over and be the cause of all kinds of 
		humiliation. Contrary, however, to what we might have feared, if we stop 
		this resisting and investigate how able we are to receive the emotion 
		just as it presents itself, we will find an increased sense of 
		confidence and self-respect, as we contact and develop our capacity for 
		staying present with whatever arises. Little by little, this will take 
		us into a relationship that feels much more appropriate, more humane. 
		From the perspective of a willingness to fully allow this dimension of 
		ourselves, we will see directly that stuffing emotions out of sight is 
		an unkind, even an abusive thing to do. No wonder we didn’t feel like 
		our own best friend!<br>
		<br>
		Sadly, it is often the case that we haven’t had adequate examples of 
		people who knew how to be accommodating of their own emotional 
		household. The guardians and mentors who were responsible for our 
		education and upbringing were often themselves suffering from the 
		consequences of their own unawareness, and this inevitably rubbed off 
		onto us. We learned the patterns of behaviour of the people that we 
		lived with and picked up their habit of forcing that which we don’t like 
		or are afraid of into the basement, hoping it will disappear.<br>
		<br>
		But as the years went by we may have started to feel like there was 
		something missing. A big empty feeling in our stomach or in our heart 
		makes us feel that there is something lacking. The existence of this 
		feeling in society at large is a significant factor as the driving force 
		behind our consumer culture. It runs on this perception of something 
		lacking. But no matter how much we try to assuage this feeling with 
		‘retail therapy’, our sense of personal integrity does not increase. We 
		can feel like we are living someone else’s life and in constant fear of 
		being found out.<br>
		<br>
		Whenever I have read the colour supplement of the weekend newspaper – 
		sometimes people leave us newspapers at the monastery – there are always 
		these eye-catching pictures of food. I find myself wondering if people 
		really eat like the pictures encourage them to. I mean you couldn’t live 
		on those little weenie portions in the middle of that stylish plate. It 
		looks more like a piece of graphic art than a meal, which often, of 
		course, is what it is. It’s a designer exercise whose purpose is 
		distraction. The same principle holds for various sporting activities. I 
		recently stayed with a friend of the community in Leeds and watched a 
		television program on extreme sports. ‘Extreme’ is a good description 
		for much of the activity we engage in. But what is it that is driving 
		such activity? <br>
		<br>
		Instead of attempting to cover up the empty feeling with food or perfume 
		or extreme sports, the practice of Dhamma encourages us to trust that, 
		if we discipline attention carefully and skilfully, we can turn around 
		and receive that feeling without reacting or shying away from it. How 
		does it actually feel to feel, ‘I want something and I feel this sense 
		of lack, this sense that I’m not all here’? If we really listen to this, 
		what we can find, instead of an increase in our suffering as our 
		perceived enemy takes us over, is a genuine, naturally arising, warm 
		sense of joy. <br>
		<br>
		When I allow this feeling of lack – often in the belly – to be received, 
		I feel more honest and more genuinely alive. Related aspects of the 
		experience start arising – memories and sensations – and if I track 
		them, if I follow them and listen to them, not getting lost in them, not 
		getting into arguments with them but simply receiving them with kindness 
		and patience, I start to feel that there is all this unlived life, 
		emotions that I didn’t want to live through, didn’t like, didn’t agree 
		with and therefore stuffed them in the basement. We feel like we’re 
		lacking, because we are lacking. There’s all this unacknowledged life of 
		ours that has been driven into unawareness, that’s unreceived, unlived 
		through and it’s getting very antsy.<br>
		<br>
		Sooner or later in practice we come to a stage where we can no longer 
		ignore the fact that we feel that something is not right; a stage when 
		affirmations and the various other devices don’t work any more. We 
		always have the option of giving up, of course, and indulging our 
		beliefs in the possibility of fulfilment offered by sense gratification. 
		However, we also have the possibility of continuing on our path of 
		practice: that of listening deeply and receiving our emotions with 
		increased willingness.<br>
		<br>
		We might hear all these growling noises coming from down below and 
		think, ‘Oh my goodness, what’s going to happen if I lift the lid off 
		that?’ There can be a very real fear that arises when we find ourselves 
		starting to encounter our unlived life. Habitually there might be 
		thoughts of wanting to reach for the bottle, roll some weed or put on 
		some good music – of doing anything but feeling this terrible feeling 
		that we’re going to be taken over by something unknown and terrifying.<br>
		<br>
		But what is there that would take us over anyway? This is England, for 
		goodness sake! This is not some unfortunate country full of tyrants 
		oppressing us; this is England, sweet England. Thankfully for us there 
		isn’t anything ‘out there’ that will harm us. The only thing that could 
		possibly take us over is our own wild nature. And since that is our 
		energy, surely there is nothing to be afraid of. Of course it can, and 
		at times does, feel like there is something to fear, but let us remember 
		that, just because we feel afraid, it does not mean anything terrible is 
		about to happen. How many times have we been fooled by the way these 
		beguiling emotions appear?<br>
		<br>
		Rather than asking what emotions are, let us try asking, ‘How freely can 
		I receive myself in this domain of experience?’, and then let them teach 
		us about life, about reality. If in asking that question we come upon a 
		feeling of obstruction, let’s get interested in that. ‘How and where do 
		I feel obstructed? Is it in the belly? Is it in the throat? Is there a 
		sense that I am not allowed to feel these things? Is that what causes 
		the feeling of being blocked or not allowed to know myself?’ <br>
		<br>
		If you were brought up in a rigid and repressive manner perhaps you were 
		taught that it wasn’t okay to feel certain feelings – guilt for 
		instance. Or if you did feel guilty you were told you had to go through 
		the formula of asking for forgiveness to get rid of that feeling. If you 
		continued to feel guilty that meant you were not, and could not be, part 
		of ‘the club’ – you were out, you were going down. In my early life I 
		found that no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t stop feeling guilty. I 
		certainly didn’t want to stop doing the fun things that were making me 
		feel guilty, so what was left to do but deny it? Feeling guilty about 
		living is so irrational that the rational mind decides to ignore the 
		feeling. Big mistake! As a result we end up developing a habit of 
		denying whatever it is we are feeling, in this case the feeling of 
		guilt. In doing this we deny an entire domain of our lives – not just 
		the painful feelings but even good feelings we are not free to feel. Now 
		that’s sad.<br>
		<br>
		Feelings of guilt, like all emotions, are forms of what we could call 
		‘heart-energy’. And when this energy, which in its nature is dynamic, is 
		denied, it will come out in one of two ways; either as excess or as 
		perversion. What might have been a healthy sense of moral shame can thus 
		become a distorted sense of unworthiness. This peculiarly Western mental 
		obstruction is a complex of anger and fear – a sense of righteous anger 
		directed towards ourselves in an attempt to feel good by hating 
		ourselves for being bad. And at the same time there is a gut-wrenching 
		fear of eternal hell. <br>
		<br>
		The good news, however, is that this whole drama is simply waiting to be 
		received into awareness. With sensitivity and strength of heart born of 
		constant mindfulness practice we can eventually find a readiness to turn 
		around and meet ourselves. What we discover is the wonderful truth that 
		there isn’t anything to be afraid of – nothing at all other than the 
		lack of well-prepared mindfulness.<br>
		<br>
		This line of investigation can be applied to all emotions. If for 
		instance we push down anger, if we’ve been taught that ‘good boys and 
		girls don’t get angry’ then we might grow up to be afraid of anger. We 
		can be terrified of something that is totally natural. That which we 
		experience as anger is actually our own hearts’ energy. It is something 
		that we need to be intimately familiar with. We need all our energy for 
		the work of purification. We can’t lock away portions of our hearts 
		because we find them disagreeable. We can’t afford to entertain feelings 
		of alienation and fear of our passionate nature. If such conditioning 
		goes unrecognised for too long, the energy – hidden and difficult to 
		uncover – will become toxic. <br>
		<br>
		We might have to go through a humiliating outburst of anger before we 
		start to suspect that it is there. Or perhaps we experience night after 
		night of violent dreams. If the energy remains unreceived then the only 
		alternative is a descent, as I mentioned, into perversion or excess. For 
		the more introverted types, in which category most meditators fall, 
		self-loathing is often the norm. ‘I’m worthless, I’m a hopeless case, 
		and I’ve failed everything. I just put on a face and pretend, but 
		basically I’m damaged goods. I hate myself so much’. Or paranoia: 
		‘Everybody hates me, everybody is out to harm me.’<br>
		<br>
		The more extroverted character is likely to fall into expressions of 
		excess like violence and aggression. We can see this in the way people 
		go out on drinking binges, or become violent in their relationships or 
		families. Is such ugliness a symptom of people’s inherent badness? Not 
		at all; it’s a sign that anger has not been understood. Anger, in not 
		being received, is uncontained and dangerous, but the issue is with the 
		relationship we have with the energy, not with the energy itself. As 
		meditators we really need to understand this. And I believe such 
		understanding can come if we are interested in the actuality of what we 
		call emotions, not merely in conceptualizations of them.<br>
		<br>
		If we embark on such an investigation, we will not only come to a 
		greater personal sense of contentment, but we may also find a clearer 
		appreciation of why our world is such a strange place and what we can do 
		to help it.<br>
		<br>
