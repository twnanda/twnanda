		&nbsp;Tasting the flavour of solitude and the nectar of peace,<br>
		those who drink the joy that is the essence of reality <br>
		abide free from fear of evil.</i><br>
		<br>
		Dhammapada verse 205<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Question: Can you explain the relative merits of practising as a 
		monastic and practising as a householder? Could you also describe any 
		general patterns of personality change that you have noticed in people 
		as a result of Buddhist practice?<br>
		<br>
		Ajahn Munindo: Whether one lives the life of a celibate renunciate, as a 
		monk or nun, or whether one lives as a layperson, a householder, is a 
		question of one’s choice of lifestyle. That choice is not just about 
		personal preferences but has to do with all sorts of conditions – our 
		accumulations, our kamma. It is a basic premise of the Buddhist outlook 
		that we did not come into the world as a blank sheet but with a history 
		and a set of tendencies. What we came into this life with, forms the 
		context and the background against which our life’s unfolding takes 
		place, the details of which most of us can’t see. <br>
		<br>
		For all of us, however – monks, nuns or lay people – the practice is 
		essentially the same. We all encounter frustration, limited existence 
		and suffering. What matters is whether we are willing to receive our 
		suffering consciously and look into the actuality of it, or whether we 
		are committed – knowingly or unknowingly – to distraction and avoidance 
		in order to delay looking at what is truly taking place. In both the 
		householders’ life and the monastic life there is the full spectrum of 
		commitment, from those who are enthusiastically committed to seeing what 
		the reality of each moment is, to those occupied in distraction. What 
		matters is whether our lifestyle is true for us and whether it helps us 
		develop increased willingness. Willingness is what matters.<br>
		<br>
		The reality, whatever our choice of lifestyle, is that throughout our 
		life we have to face the evidence of our limitations. Whether we like it 
		or not, we all experience not getting our own way and becoming lost in 
		habitual reactivity. When we come right up against those experiences, 
		how do we respond? Do we resist, saying, ‘I shouldn’t be this way, I 
		should be more clear about where I’m going in my life;’ or is there the 
		heart-capacity to meet this person – me – in this experience of 
		limitation in an unobstructed way?<br>
		<br>
		<i>Encountering Loneliness</i><br>
		<br>
		To speak personally, I can say that living as a monk, has been a 
		difficult choice but that I don’t have any regrets. I do regret some of 
		the ways I have handled certain situations in the past but I don’t 
		regret having chosen to live the life of a monk. I feel very privileged 
		and fortunate to live this life, and the longer I live it the more that 
		feeling grows. It’s fundamentally about living in solitude and getting 
		to know your aloneness. Yes, monks live together in community but in our 
		togetherness we are alone. The structures of the life bring us to an 
		intense recognition of our aloneness and the agony of loneliness.<br>
		<br>
		For someone who lives the monastic life of a celibate renunciate, 
		loneliness is not considered as a symptom of failure. It is looked upon 
		as an indicator – a sign. When you feel the pain of loneliness as 
		horrible – just as it is – it does not mean failure. This feeling tells 
		you where your resources are, where you need to go to get your gold; so 
		it’s something that we train ourselves to welcome and look into. We are 
		supposed to feel lonely – at least until we realize contentment in our 
		aloneness. From this perspective, compulsive socialising or any heedless 
		activity that distracts us from an accurate, personal, receptivity to 
		the experience of loneliness is seen as a hindrance. <br>
		<br>
		There are monastic communities in both Buddhist and non-Buddhist 
		traditions in which there are movements towards socialising and group 
		activity, but according to my understanding and observation of these 
		things, invariably either those activities die out or the communities 
		themselves die. The reason is that the monastic life is essentially 
		solitary – it’s all about being alone. The decision to live such a life 
		is made for all sorts of reasons, but ultimately it needs to be made 
		because we find it in our nature to make that choice. It’s not right or 
		wrong to live the monastic life or to live a householder’s life. We 
		choose whatever is appropriate for our condition – whatever supports us 
		in our commitment to the path of practice. <br>
		<br>
		Anybody who has lived the life of a monk, a nun or a postulant for any 
		length of time knows the pain of loneliness, but hopefully has also 
		tasted the benefit of being supported by the spiritual community in 
		their encounter with it. The spiritual community is a very important 
		support in encouraging us to go deeper into all aspects of our 
		experience – perhaps into loneliness even more than other aspects. To 
		try and live monastically without any support would be very difficult. 
		Because of this, the Buddha encouraged the spiritual community, the 
		Sangha, to make a shared commitment to a celibate renunciate lifestyle, 
		and to support each other in their efforts. <br>
		<br>
		If we have adequately prepared ourselves with strength of mindfulness 
		and steadiness of samadhi, along with the self-respect that comes with 
		sense-restraint and moral conduct, then we can embrace the energetic 
		reality of loneliness. Instead of thinking, ‘I feel lonely, what can I 
		do to get rid of this feeling of loneliness? I’ll write an e-mail, read 
		a book, or ring somebody up,’ we open up to receive – without any 
		judgment or analysis – the feeling of loneliness. To be encouraged to do 
		that is a wonderful thing and is very much a part of what the spiritual 
		community is about.<br>
		<br>
		As a householder or a layperson it is not necessarily the case that you 
		will be forced to confront loneliness in the same manner as a monk or 
		nun will be. Living with a partner in a committed relationship, for 
		example – in many cases with children as well – brings a very different 
		experience altogether. Assuming that such a relationship is not 
		destructive or dysfunctional, there will be a sense of companionship – 
		close, intimate companionship. Since the last close intimate 
		companionship I had was about thirty years ago, there is little I can 
		say about that. But from what people tell me, committing to a close 
		relationship doesn’t protect anyone from the pain of loneliness. So 
		whatever our lifestyle choice, all of us who are committed to practice 
		are called to go deeply into this experience and find our own way to a 
		resolution. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Personality Shifts</i><br>
		<br>
		With regards to changes in personality through practice, nowadays what I 
		see in everybody who is training, whether monastic or lay person, is a 
		shift in heart towards an increased willingness to receive the present 
		moment in its fullness – without interpretation, indulgence or 
		avoidance. <br>
		<br>
		In any experience our mind can imagine all sorts of possible outcomes, 
		some agreeable and some disagreeable. We can become very anxious because 
		of these imagined possibilities. However, if we practise rightly and 
		truly, we find ourselves increasingly capable of accommodating all sorts 
		of eventualities – both the frightening and the wonderful. I have found 
		this to be true throughout my years of training and have observed it 
		growing in many with whom I have lived. Witnessing such increase of 
		capacity is always a joy.<br>
		<br>
		I received a letter today from someone who lives in Eastern Europe and 
		has been practising for a few years. He’s young and very enthusiastic in 
		his practice and has just recognised that he’s been attached to the 
		conceited view that he is in the best religion. There is nobody in his 
		family and hardly anyone else in his immediate environment who is a 
		Buddhist, so he’s very much a solitary Buddhist. He’s been holding onto 
		an idea of himself as a Buddhist in a very tight way, which is quite 
		understandable – that’s generally how we all begin. But because of his 
		right practice he has reached the point where he’s started to loosen the 
		way he holds the perception of himself as a Buddhist, and has come to 
		realise how conceited his view was that ‘I am a Buddhist and Buddhism is 
		the best religion there is.’ <br>
		<br>
		In his letter he discribed how, having seen his conceit, he became 
		caught in terrible doubt. He thought, ‘I’ve been brain-washed. Buddhism 
		is just another system of brainwashing.’ He wrote that he’d been 
		watching a video of Nazis in Germany in the 1930’s, in which the Nazi 
		youth were going round teaching the young people to sing nationalistic 
		songs praising Hitler and so on. The Nazis were skilled at programming 
		large numbers of people to hold specific views and beliefs, to conform 
		to a fixed idea. <br>
		<br>
		Seeing this video coincided with him recognising how rigid his grasp of 
		Buddhism was. He fell into this hellish doubt in which he decided that 
		he had been thoroughly mistaken and that Buddhism was, in fact, just a 
		load of codswallop! ‘This is just another form of programming for 
		imbeciles!’ he thought to himself, believing that he’d made a terrible 
		and humiliating mistake. <br>
		<br>
		Fortunately, his practice was adequately balanced so that he was soon 
		able to reflect on the shift in his experience and on the doubt he was 
		caught up in. The reality of his experience was that he was having 
		doubts, that’s all. He didn’t know that Buddhism was a load of 
		codswallop; he didn’t know that he’d been programmed into believing some 
		cultic nonsense. His practice was sufficiently broad, non-judgmental and 
		here-and-now that he was able to accommodate his doubt without grasping 
		it, without becoming it. If in that moment when the thought arose – 
		‘I’ve been programmed by a cult of fanatic monks and Ajahn Munindo is 
		another sort of a Nazi’ – he hadn’t been properly prepared, then he 
		could have thrown the whole thing out of the window, gone out drinking 
		with his mates and created a whole lot of unskilful kamma. I am 
		impressed with the way this young man went through this period – on his 
		own – allowing the doubt to be there. He allowed the real possibility 
		that he’d got it all wrong to remain in his consciousness, without 
		losing the balance of his mind. His willingness to experience the doubt 
		took him through to some insight into the nature of doubting. <br>
		<br>
		As we continue in the practice of the Buddha-Dhamma we find an increased 
		willingness to accommodate all sorts of possibilities that come to us. 
		We don’t jump to conclusions so readily, and because of this, the heart 
		and mind begins to expand in a more open and easeful way. By our 
		practice of restraint we find that there are more, not fewer, 
		possibilities. Practitioners become more relaxed, they become more 
		trusting. This is the sort of personality change your might expect from 
		practice.<br>
		<br>
		Certainly, my experience has been that, instead of having to feel sure 
		about things, I am able to let myself be not so sure. Sometimes people 
		tell me that when I talk I sound very sure and confident, but that is 
		not necessarily my subjective experience. When I talk about Dhamma, what 
		I am concerned with is encouraging investigation. At the end of a Dhamma 
		talk I hope the listeners have more and deeper questions than at the 
		start. However, when I meet my brothers and sisters and their partners, 
		who are all evangelical Christians, then I know that I am meeting people 
		who are really sure. If they are not travelling the world as 
		missionaries in Africa, Turkey, India, or the United States, they are 
		preaching and running churches near home. They don’t have any doubts at 
		all – certainly not conscious ones. They are very much convinced that 
		they have the answers. In that respect we are worlds apart because I 
		can’t say that I have the answers. I feel connected to a reality which 
		is much bigger than me – something beyond delineations of inner and 
		outer – a reality that I care about tremendously. And this is something 
		that I wholeheartedly commit my life in service to; but I can’t say that 
		I know or that I’m sure. I welcome this state of uncertainty – I think 
		it’s a healthy condition. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Not Sure</i><br>
		<br>
		As far as making right effort in daily life – accommodating family 
		situations, community situations and other people – I think this 
		particular point is very relevant. Recognising that, in reality, we are 
		not sure most of the time makes us much nicer people to be with. If, out 
		of fear of being unsure, we hold on to ideas and take fixed positions, 
		we can become very rigid. If I feel sufficiently threatened in certain 
		situations, a fear comes up and there’s an experience of contraction – a 
		rigidity kicks in, and when that kicks in, possibilities become limited. 
		My mind doesn’t want to look at the myriads of possibilities, doesn’t 
		want to float around and feel what’s actually going to fit. In that 
		state of contraction and limitation it wants to get something and feel 
		sure. But this doesn’t benefit me and it doesn’t benefit other people. 
		On the other hand, when we are able to remember that we don’t know what 
		is going to happen – that we don’t know for certain – then there is a 
		relaxation, a releasing; an opening up and a trusting, a reconnecting 
		with a trusting relationship to life. Life is uncertain but that is just 
		the truth. We don’t have to be in a perpetual state of fear because of 
		it.<br>
		<br>
		There are many contemplations that aim at leading us into a trusting 
		relationship to life, but I think this reflection on the fact that most 
		of the time we don’t know what is going to happen is especially useful. 
		When the tendency to grasp out of fear or insecurity arises, if we have 
		prepared ourselves, we hold back and just wait, remaining open and at 
		the same time in touch with the sense of ‘not sure’. This was one of 
		Ajahn Chah’s most regular teachings, perhaps his most regular teaching. 
		Whatever you said to him, after he responded he would often add, ‘but…mai 
		neh, mai neh,’ not sure. Neh – which comes from the Pali word nicca, 
		meaning ‘permanent’ – in Thai means ‘sure’ or ‘certain’. Mai is 
		negative. That was really the bottom line in all of his teaching. 
		Whatever arrangements were being made, ‘We’re going to do this’ or ‘Next 
		week I’m going to Bangkok,’ he would regularly say ‘mai neh’, ‘but not 
		sure.’ Not because he lacked commitment – he was anything but 
		wishy-washy; but because he wanted us to see the Dhamma in all of our 
		activity.<br>
		<br>
		On the day that Ajahn Chah died in 1992 a friend of the monastery 
		offered a lamp as a gift to mark the occasion. We switched this lamp on 
		for the next ten days and nights as a gesture of our respect. After this 
		period we held a Memorial Service in the Dhamma Hall here. A large 
		gathering of people from Newcastle and the surrounding area came 
		together for chanting and meditation, to reflect with gratitude on our 
		teacher who had just passed away. At the Memorial Service I read a talk 
		from a collection of Ajahn Chah’s teachings called Food For The Heart. 
		It was on Ajahn Chah’s favourite theme – impermanence. The words in this 
		talk gained a new significance as I read them. When I came to this 
		important passage, the key sentence of the whole talk, which says, ‘…and 
		any teaching from any teacher that does not include the words 
		impermanence…’ the light bulb blew ‘...is not the teaching of the 
		Buddha….’ I had to stop for a few moments. I suppose these things 
		happen, don’t they? What causes them, what is actually going on – who 
		knows? But it certainly etched that particular aspect of Ajahn Chah’s 
		teaching even more deeply in my mind: <br>
		<br>
		‘Any teaching that does not contain the words not sure or impermanent is 
		not the teaching of the Buddha.’<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Thank you very much for your attention this evening.</font></p>
