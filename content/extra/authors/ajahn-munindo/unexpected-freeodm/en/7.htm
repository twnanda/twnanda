		As rain cannot penetrate<br>
		a well-thatched roof, <br>
		so the passions<br>
		cannot invade a well-trained heart.</i><br>
		<br>
		Dhammapada verse 14<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		The passion of anger is something that most of us are tripped up by, at 
		least from time to time. For some of us it is a source of major struggle 
		in our lives. It is useful to acknowledge that it is only when we have 
		some degree of calmness, some perspective of coolness, that we are in a 
		position to effectively reflect on such matters. When we are all fired 
		up with passion, of whatever sort, we simply don’t have the perspective 
		or the clarity. Of course, we are capable of some sort of thinking under 
		such circumstances, but such thinking is likely to be driven in 
		conditioned ways, desperate to find an escape from the pain of being 
		caught up. Whether it is by anger, lust or fear, we can be driven in 
		narrow, habitual directions in order to release ourselves from the 
		agitation of being possessed. Let us take this opportunity to reflect on 
		the nature of these passions.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Reconsidering the enemy</i><br>
		<br>
		In late 1987 a hurricane raged across the south of England and France. 
		Millions of trees were uprooted. In the forests belonging to our 
		monastery at Chithurst about one third of the oak trees were brought 
		down. It was a sad sight, one that caused everyone to feel disheartened. 
		Yet a mere five years later the woods were welcomingly beautiful again, 
		more open and brighter than before. Not only that, but here at Harnham 
		we have benefited from the hurricane in that we have this lovely solid 
		oak floor in our Meditation Hall.<br>
		<br>
		The hurricane gives me an image of what tends to happen when we are 
		faced with things we don’t like. We readily perceive such things as the 
		enemy and tend to see them as evidence of something going wrong. Because 
		we follow this initial perception, we don’t give ourselves the 
		opportunity to reconsider our assessment; the result is that we behave 
		in ways that can have serious and often tragic consequences.<br>
		<br>
		Nature can teach us to develop wisdom by encouraging us to reflect on 
		our habitual initial reactions that make us feel threatened and 
		judgemental. When we are feeling hurt or threatened by circumstances we 
		can easily react in shortsighted ways. Our untrained and untamed 
		passionate nature is such that when anger arises we get caught up in it 
		and misperceive situations. This wild energy, if not wisely contained, 
		moves us to want to cause harm and to hurt others. We may recall the 
		Buddha’s words, ‘When we hold fast to such thoughts as, “They abused me, 
		mistreated me, molested me, robbed me” we keep hatred alive.’ The heat 
		comes up from our bellies so that the anger can possess our hearts and 
		then go all the way up into our heads. If we are heedless, anger starts 
		coming out through our mouth or through our limbs, or it can whirl 
		around our heads and drive us crazy with ideas and fantasies. All this 
		can go on until the energy has been spent.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Degrees of passionate distraction</i><br>
		<br>
		How did the Buddha teach us to approach these things? Something he often 
		encouraged is called in Pali yoniso manasikara – wise reflection, or 
		wise contemplation. Moral restraint and wilful control have an important 
		place in learning to transform our anger but to make them really 
		effective, it helps to prepare ourselves more thoroughly. We are not to 
		wait until we are caught up in anger before we contemplate it. 
		Contemplating our moods or responses of anger is very different from 
		being caught up in anger, when there is an ongoing proliferation of the 
		angry feelings and thoughts. The difference between proliferation and 
		contemplation is that when we contemplate, we can stop the thinking 
		without struggle and comfortably return to silence – we can listen to 
		silence. We are able to disengage from the momentum of mental activity. 
		We come back to feeling what it feels like in our guts, in our heart, on 
		our face. If it’s proliferation, we’re driven by anger, and we lose 
		touch with the body.<br>
		<br>
		In support of this skilful contemplation the Buddha gave a specific 
		model of the different degrees of intensity of moods and mental 
		disturbances. There are some obstructions, he said, that arise in the 
		mind that are of little significance, such that by simply ignoring them 
		they will go away. There is another sort of obstruction that will 
		disappear, if after noticing them, we intentionally return to the 
		meditation object. This type of disturbance has only a little energy in 
		it. <br>
		<br>
		There is a third sort of distraction of a higher level of intensity 
		which we cannot effectively just turn away from. To try to do so doesn’t 
		work – the distraction keeps returning. We therefore have to leave our 
		meditation object and look directly at the phenomenon itself and 
		generate a counterforce. If, for instance, the mind is caught up in 
		anger, what can help is to generate the forces of loving kindness and 
		compassion.<br>
		<br>
		There is a further degree of obstruction in which we need to analyse the 
		distraction before the mind is released from it. We have to ask, ‘What 
		is going on here? What is the nature of this anger anyway?’ We have to 
		really consider the passion and its energy, and bring to mind the 
		contemplations on the three characteristics of impermanence, 
		unsatisfactoriness and not-self. <br>
		<br>
		Finally, there are some disturbances which come to us about which the 
		Buddha said that all we can do is push our tongue up against the roof of 
		our mouth, grit our teeth and endure until it passes. This level of 
		intensity is such that we can’t deal with it at the time of its arising.
		<br>
		<br>
		I have found it very helpful to become quite clear about these differing 
		levels of intensity of distraction. It is not the case that we should be 
		applying the same kind of effort towards every distraction that arises 
		in meditation. To know that sometimes we can’t deal with a distraction 
		right now is important. When strong passion arises, sometimes all we can 
		do is endure it, not act on it. We don’t allow it to go up into our head 
		and fuel compulsive thinking. Carefully and mindfully we hold the 
		experience of anger as and where we first notice it, in our body and our 
		mind. This is not repression – which is a blind reaction – so we don’t 
		need to be afraid of this practice. This is a conscious choice to 
		withhold our tendency to indulge. If we do indulge in it and act with 
		body, speech or mind, we are creating kamma, which, like throwing a 
		stone into a pond, creates ripples. We might think at the time that to 
		release the tension will make us feel better, but the reality is 
		altogether different, and so the Buddha’s encouragement was that we 
		should do whatever it takes to endure it. We can consciously choose to 
		meet our rage. We can choose not to act it out or repress it. We can 
		choose to endure it.<br>
		<br>
		In the case of coping with truly overwhelming passion, a simile that the 
		Buddha used was that of a strong man pushing down a weaker man in a 
		fight. We are actually holding something down. It’s as though we were 
		dealing with someone who is deranged. Imagine you are in a public place 
		where everybody is calmly going about their normal business, but a mad 
		person turns up, drunk or unhinged, behaving in a dangerous manner – 
		someone really out of control. In such a situation we just pin them down 
		to the floor and hold them there. We don’t introduce ourselves and say, 
		‘Shall we share our feelings? Let’s talk about it together.’ What is 
		called for is to restrain them and hold them until they recover their 
		senses. Only then can we relate in a more civil manner.<br>
		<br>
		So mindful restraint is the first line of defence against an attack by 
		wild anger. We don’t make it worse by following it. Although it may test 
		our ability to the point of feeling like we might crack, it will 
		eventually pass.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Believing in anger<br>
		</i>
		<br>
		Another aspect of wisely reflecting on our anger is to consider whether 
		it is really the case – as we can believe when we are fired up – that 
		following such passion will make things better. One evening after giving 
		a talk on anger at the monastery somebody asked the question, “How can I 
		let go of anger when it feels so good to follow it?” They said, “I just 
		love having a go at one particular person who I think is really stupid.” 
		I didn’t know what to reply to them. If we are convinced that it is good 
		to indulge in aggression, then there is little that we can change. 
		However, if we are committed to meditation practice and have some access 
		to the peaceful heart, we can know how beautiful a heart free from anger 
		is. It is because we don’t know about this possibility that we become 
		caught up. From the perspective of identifying with our bodily senses we 
		experience the passions as who and what we are. On that level it can 
		feel good to feel this power of anger. When we get passionately 
		righteous and indignant, our rage feels so energising. Our sense of self 
		is potentised and this leads us to conclude that anger is good. We 
		believe that we are going to get something out of following it. So long 
		as we haven’t deeply investigated this aspect of ourselves we can be 
		fooled into thinking that acting out our anger is somehow going to 
		benefit us.<br>
		<br>
		Sitting here now talking about it, it sounds crazy, doesn’t it, but this 
		is what happens. This is why people commit the most awful atrocities 
		that, from the perspective of those of us who have never been in a war 
		situation, are utterly incomprehensible. If we were not there in the 
		former Yugoslavia a few years ago, or in Rwanda before that – or who 
		knows where next – and we hear of all the slaughter, the rape and 
		torture, the unbelievable horror, it is very difficult to take any of it 
		in and make sense of it. However, the reality of such atrocities becomes 
		at least conceivable if we have enquired into our own experience of 
		getting caught up in passion to the point that that passion possesses 
		us. We can see how, when this happens, when we become possessed by 
		hatred, when we allow ourselves to be convinced that acting out this 
		hatred will solve the problem, how then we are capable of absolutely 
		anything. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Facing the consequences<br>
		</i>
		<br>
		Sometimes, after we have experienced an up-thrust or even an outburst of 
		passionate rage, and the fires have subsided, we just go on to distract 
		ourselves, trying not to think about it any more. That approach to 
		dealing with our faults does not work. The reason we have become caught 
		up in anger in the first place is because there is something in us we 
		have not yet recognised. <br>
		<br>
		At such times we can also go against the inclination to avoid what we 
		are feeling and instead turn towards it and fully receive it. Something 
		within us might fear that to do so will involve the risk of being taken 
		over by it. It is true that we need to approach this task sensitively 
		and skilfully, but with right practice we can equip ourselves with the 
		ability to fully face the consequences of our heedlessness. Those 
		consequences are painful. If we are consistent and non-judgemental, 
		these same painful feelings gradually give us the message that to allow 
		ourselves to follow this energy, no matter how tempting it appears, 
		leads to making things worse. We are losing out. When we begin to get a 
		feeling for the integrity of this practice we become more willing to 
		open to our weakness. Having survived the humiliation of losing our 
		composure, we can afterwards stop and reflect and get to the point of 
		acknowledging with humility, ‘I actually lost it there, didn’t I? – I 
		got caught up in the heat’ <br>
		<br>
		It can be helpful at this point to mentally rerun the drama. I might 
		notice that the fire gets stirred up in the belly, and because I miss it 
		there, it continues upward and invades my heart, then my head and then 
		starts coming out through the mouth. Just this kind of contemplation can 
		prepare us, so that next time we are about to be swept away in a 
		firestorm, we remember ourselves. We can recall what happened the last 
		time we followed the passion, and this time around find other ways of 
		channelling it. Go jogging – jog until you are exhausted. Take a cold 
		shower; do some yoga; do walking meditation – quickly if necessary; do 
		anything rather than acting on the anger, letting it control you, 
		letting it drive you into making more unskilful kamma. If we try to 
		contemplate what is happening before we have cooled down properly, then 
		we might become caught up again and continue to dwell on the event, 
		thinking, ‘I was in the right, I was perfectly justified!’ and so on. 
		But even that is something we can learn from, if we are willing. Some 
		physical activity might be necessary initially as a way of dissipating 
		the energy so that we can be in a suitable state to consider what 
		happened.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>The benefits of consistent effort<br>
		</i>
		<br>
		Another useful way of viewing anger is to see it simply as energy. This 
		is energy that is to be purified and transformed. It is not something 
		just to get rid of or to vent. This is something to be understood, and 
		in order to do this our relationship with it also needs to be purified.<br>
		<br>
		The first level of purification is containment or restraint. We restrain 
		ourselves from acting out the motive forces that are gaining momentum 
		within us, no matter how uncomfortable that experience is for us. There 
		is power in such mindful restraint and this leads us to being able to 
		engage the energy intelligently and creatively.<br>
		<br>
		A good friend once suggested to me that home visits were the best 
		barometer for practice in this area. I think he was right. I know that 
		whenever I used to go back to New Zealand to see my family there 
		couldn’t be a more fertile source of opportunity for restraining my 
		emotional reactions. There were seemingly endless opportunities for 
		becoming indignant. While other family members, who were having more 
		children or earning more money, received praise and recognition, the 
		fact that I had been enthusiastically and consistently committed to the 
		life of a renunciate monk for twenty-odd years received no appreciation. 
		When I was younger, this stony indifference to my spiritual orientation 
		was a cause of considerable upset and hot-temperedness on my part. Of 
		course my reason came up with rational explanations for my family’s 
		behaviour, but inside I could hear the voice of my indignation, saying, 
		“But what about me? Doesn’t it count for something that I have been 
		getting up every morning rededicating my life to all sentient beings and 
		working hard to help others? And, and...” I would regularly come down 
		with a sore throat, an eye infection or some disease that was 
		symptomatic of the inner struggle I was having with my rage. As I grew 
		older, both physically and in the training, those inner voices became 
		much quieter. I have learned how good it feels to not have to react, so 
		that I can go away with my dignity intact. I cannot say that the voices 
		are never there but the relationship I have with them is very different 
		from what it was. I find I can respect them. At the very least I can 
		endure them! With this inner shift, home visits have become more 
		harmonious. <br>
		<br>
		With this practice I learn to see such thoughts as, ‘what about me?’ as 
		expressions of our heart’s precious energy. We are free to allow that 
		energy to be kidnapped by the deluded conditioning of our minds and be 
		wasted on indignation and blame if we wish, but we are also free to 
		engage that same energy in the cultivation of strength of heart. 
		Patience is nourishing; compassion is nourishing; and ill will, anger 
		and resentment are not the enemies of these virtues. This raw energy is 
		an indicator of where our heart is. <br>
		<br>
		At times I stand by the monastery compost heap and consciously register 
		how thoroughly unattractive it smells. I then go on to reflect how this 
		bad-smelling muck will soon be giving nourishment and beauty to the 
		garden. Just because our hearts manifest in unrefined and unattractive 
		ways, it does not mean we are bad people or that the energy itself 
		should be disposed of. We would be wise to withhold our initial 
		reactions and look deeper.<br>
		<br>
		This cultivation is hard at times but it does bring benefits. When I was 
		a young monk someone once threw a tomato at me, and it took several days 
		for me to recover from the hurt feelings. What I can say now, some years 
		later, is that it takes less time. Not that tomatoes are thrown at me 
		every day, but occasionally a little abuse is hurled my way. I mention 
		this as an example of what changes. I am not so interested in never 
		feeling anger. What is more interesting is being free to own up to the 
		energy in my reactions and take full responsibility for them – not to be 
		driven by them. This is the only energy we have. This is the energy of 
		practice. Our task is to train so as to be able to recognise this 
		passionate energy for what it is, not mistaking it as our enemy. <br>
		<br>
		To view our passionate nature as something we have to either indulge in 
		or project out limits the possibilities in life. If, for instance, we 
		have suffered abuse and remain locked into the state of resentment, 
		feeling unable to forgive, we sooner or later need to recognise that it 
		is we who are doing the resentment. One reason we continue to do it is 
		that we believe that to do so will be beneficial to us. But there is no 
		benefit, only increased suffering for all involved. By reviewing this 
		way of approaching resentment with mindfulness and wise contemplation, 
		we can learn to withdraw our investment of energy in it and uncover the 
		first seeds of forgiveness. To forgive, as we have often heard, does not 
		mean to forget. But it can mean to be free from wasting our heart’s 
		energy on negativity. We are not obliged to invest our energy 
		negatively. It is a choice. If we wish, we can direct it in ways that 
		lead to increased freedom from suffering.<br>
		<br>
		From the perspective of Buddhist practice there is nothing wrong with 
		feeling anger. In the discourses the Buddha gave on mindfulness of 
		breathing, he teaches us to feel whatever we feel, but to feel it 
		mindfully. If we feel pleasure – it is just so. So likewise, if we feel 
		anger, we feel anger – it is just so. We are not going to see our anger 
		transformed overnight, but as we become more familiar with it, we will 
		experience the freedom that comes from not fighting it. <br>
		<br>
		This change will not, however, always feel good. There will be times 
		when it will feel wonderful not to get so regularly burned, and there 
		will be times when it will feel like we are dying. We have been feeding 
		on this wild energy, either by indulgence or repression, for a long 
		time. Coming off our addictions takes its toll. The process of going 
		against our habitual reactions to the passions is challenging and should 
		not be underestimated. For this reason there are all the instructions in 
		the spiritual traditions and the support of good companions on the path 
		to encourage us in releasing out of our habits until we grow in 
		confidence. This confidence emerges out of finding our sense of who we 
		are in awareness, instead of in the limited identification with the 
		tumultuous conditions of the body and mind.<br>
		<br>
		This natural emergence leads to the insight that sees ‘the false as the 
		false’ as the Buddha put it. When we see the false as the false we can 
		then see the real as the real. As we renounce the various false ways of 
		getting energy, like indulging in anger and greed, we move naturally 
		into a new relationship with life – a more real relationship with life. 
		The focus of our attention will not be so outward. What we will be 
		feeling for is our own inner motivation – whether we are coming from a 
		place that is intending to cause harm to others or not. In that knowing 
		we can have strength and confidence. <br>
		<br>
		The Buddha himself said that he didn’t have any enemies. How could that 
		be, since even a relative of his, Devadatta, had someone try to kill 
		him? Not to mention all those monks who sided with Devadatta’s attempt 
		to take over leadership of the Sangha. The Buddha said that he didn’t 
		have enemies because he was speaking from his inner experience of being 
		fully at one with his own heart. Since he didn’t allow his heart energy 
		to flow into heedlessness, thoughts of ill will never occurred to him. 
		For him everyone, even someone who tried to kill him, was a friend. It 
		was from this understanding that the Buddha said, ‘As rain cannot 
		penetrate a well-thatched roof, so the passions cannot invade a 
		well-trained heart.’ <br>
