		Truly it is ourselves that we depend upon;<br>
		how could we really depend upon another?<br>
		When we reach the state of self-reliance <br>
		we find a rare refuge.</i><br>
		<br>
		Dhammapada verse 160<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		On this occasion I would like to discuss the effort that we are all 
		making in our work to translate the practice of Buddhism. Maybe it 
		hasn’t occurred to you that you are a translator. I would like to 
		suggest that we are all translators in the sense that the teachings 
		which we have inherited from our Asian brothers and sisters cannot be 
		simply uprooted and then replanted in another place on the planet 
		without due attention to the differing environmental conditions. While 
		we gladly recognize there are certain universal principles in the 
		teachings, there are obviously also some aspects that are relative to 
		culture and tradition. So the manner in which we are taking up Buddhist 
		practice and the kind of effort we are making is our contribution to 
		this shared task of translation. This is as important as, if not even 
		more important than, the work of translating texts. Can we become more 
		conscious of our contribution to this task as we make it?<br>
		<br>
		I have often spoken about identifying what pertains to form in the 
		teachings and what is in the domain of spirit. Mixing up these things 
		can mean that we put emphasis in the wrong place, and in so doing we end 
		up with results that we didn’t expect. But sorting out such matters is 
		far from easy. The sparkling radiance of these exotic teachings and 
		techniques readily dazzle us, especially since we have been in the dark 
		for so long. We might feel contented to settle for that initial 
		bedazzled response to this new-found light. However, the Buddha was 
		consistent in his encouragement to not be fooled by the way things 
		appear to be; only after careful scrutiny should we fully accept 
		something to be true. The point of this encouragement was that we should 
		come to know directly for ourselves the benefit of the teachings. On the 
		other hand, it is not suggesting that we dismiss things because we don’t 
		see the sense in them straight away. So how should we approach this 
		matter of discerning the spirit of the teachings?<br>
		<br>
		<i>Discerning essence</i><br>
		<br>
		The point of our taking up the Buddhist Way is to find support for our 
		heart’s yearning to be free, and it is natural that we begin by 
		observing the way in which others engage in practice. But although a 
		particular technique or system has been applied successfully by one 
		person, it does not mean that it will work for everyone. It is wise to 
		ask, ‘What is important to me? What is it that is quickened in me when I 
		see a teacher, or hear a teaching?’ I like to think about religious 
		forms as being like conventions around eating. If we are hungry, the 
		point of eating food is to become free from the discomfort of hunger. 
		Whether you go to a Japanese restaurant and eat with chopsticks, or a 
		Thai restaurant and eat with a spoon, or a place where you use a knife 
		and fork, the conventions are not the point. The point is that we are 
		fed. So it is with practice. The point is that our hearts no longer feel 
		hungry. So our task is to identify what it is that is nourishing, and to 
		focus on that. This is identifying the domain of spirit. If we give this 
		task priority, whatever this may mean in our case, then I feel the forms 
		that support the spirit will evolve rightly. Not to give spirit due 
		priority means we might be missing out on what is most of value in a 
		religious tradition.<br>
		<br>
		Something we could miss out on is a creative participation in our 
		enquiry. If our translation is going to be relevant, we have to be 
		creatively involved with it. Yes, we respect the forms that we inherit; 
		we have to begin with learning that which has been tried and tested. At 
		times this requires that we simply do what we are told; at this stage, 
		learning the form is the priority. For example, if we are learning T’ai 
		Chi, we don’t question the master because the movements feel 
		uncomfortable, and then on our third lesson make some suggestions as to 
		how the form could be altered. No; although in the beginning we might 
		feel awkward and look a little silly, we simply learn the form and 
		humbly accept that it doesn’t yet feel right, remembering that these 
		forms are supports for spirit – in this case, working with the Chi. If 
		we practise the form with commitment then we eventually learn to relax 
		into the form. Then perhaps the Chi – spirit – starts to move, and we 
		are grateful. <br>
		<br>
		So we are not dismissing forms. We take up the form and wait very 
		patiently until we are settled into it. Then we feel for the spirit 
		moving. When we are fully familiar with the spirit then that becomes the 
		priority. Now we are in touch with the essence. This way, we will be 
		able to change the forms without compromising or obstructing spirit. If 
		we attempt to adjust things too soon, based on our likes and dislikes, 
		we could be creating obstructions. <br>
		<br>
		A friend of the monastery relates a story about a valuable lesson he 
		learnt during his first year of training under a highly reputed 
		cabinet-maker. Starting out on his apprenticeship as a young man, this 
		friend had been given a brand-new, top-of-the-range hammer as a gift 
		from his father. It was perfectly balanced, with a wooden handle – just 
		what an aspiring cabinet-maker would dream of. His master instructed him 
		numerous times on how he was to hold his hammer towards the end of the 
		handle so as to gain the best swing. But although a beginner, our friend 
		thought he knew better. If you are new at carpentry, it does feel easier 
		to hold the hammer nearer the head; you feel like you can be more 
		accurate. After a number of reminders, the boss one day took hold of our 
		friend’s beautiful hammer and preceded to saw half the handle off, 
		declaring that, since he was not using that half he obviously didn’t 
		need it.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Holding rightly<br>
		</i>
		<br>
		We respectfully look at the practices that we take on, feeling for the 
		spirit. The teacher says practise this way, don’t practise that way. We 
		do what the teacher says but, as we proceed, we are checking and 
		feeling. We do not just believe. It is necessary to trust our teacher 
		but trust is not mere belief. There is a big difference between trusting 
		in what teachers are offering and believing in them and their 
		techniques. Many of us came into this path with conditioning from a 
		different religious tradition; one which holds up belief as the whole 
		point. Such an approach cannot be applied in Buddhist teachings. <br>
		<br>
		In Buddhism, beliefs are functional. We believe in things like rebirth, 
		for example; we believe that when we die we are reborn. But most of us 
		don’t know this to be objectively true. I don’t know that it’s true. I 
		believe it, but the way in which I believe it means that if somebody 
		says it is all nonsense, then we don’t have to quarrel. I don’t need 
		them to agree with me. I choose to hold a belief in the process of 
		rebirth, but I hold this belief lightly. The belief is not the end 
		point. <br>
		<br>
		When our teacher tells us to practise in a certain way, we take this 
		teaching on trust. The Buddha used an image of a goldsmith purifying 
		gold to describe our effort to purify our relationship with the 
		teachings; it’s a process of removing the dross over and over again 
		until we get pure gold. We purify our relationship to the teachings by 
		cultivating enquiry, feeling into how they work for us. When we are 
		practising various exercises and techniques and we find something is not 
		working, we start having doubts. That’s fine. Doubts do not have to be 
		an obstruction in our practice. Doubts can also indicate that the spirit 
		of enquiry is alive within us. <br>
		<br>
		Enquiry is something that comes naturally to us in the West, and we 
		should value it. This capacity for enquiry is one of the contributions 
		we are able to make to the task of translation. We shouldn’t 
		automatically assume that, because our experience appears to be 
		contradicting what someone else is saying that they are right and we are 
		wrong, or vice versa. We listen. We feel for what is being said. We 
		patiently enquire. And if we proceed with a willingness to go gradually, 
		translating everything we experience into practice, then I trust that an 
		organic and lasting understanding will be borne out of our effort.<br>
		<br>
		As we discover for ourselves what works and what does not, a confidence 
		grows, bringing benefit to us individually and to the community at 
		large. Discovering our own true way of practice is like finding a good 
		restaurant; the first thing you want to do is take your friends along. 
		My sense is that if we arrive at such confidence in a gradual way by 
		respectfully questioning as we go along, we spontaneously find our own 
		ways of expressing it. We are not just using other people’s words. Such 
		confidence will spill over – we won't even notice it happening – but 
		others will.<br>
		<br>
		<i>The two orientations of effort</i><br>
		<br>
		One way of illustrating this task of translating the practice is to look 
		more closely at how we internalise the teachings. If the kind of effort 
		we make is not coming from a place of confidence, not only are we 
		wasting energy, but we could actually be doing ourselves harm. I see a 
		lot of confusion in the way many meditators relate to the different 
		types of effort required in practice. There is sometimes quite a naïve 
		hope that by endlessly plugging away, doing what they have been doing 
		for years, something good will come out of it.<br>
		<br>
		These days I feel convinced that there are basically two different and 
		distinct orientations of effort – goal-orientation and 
		source-orientation. For many years I tried to practise by having a goal 
		‘out there’ to strive towards. My understanding of the teachings as I 
		heard them was that this was what I should be doing. I received 
		instruction in various techniques, which were oriented towards 
		realisation of this goal. The goal was called ‘enlightenment’ or ‘the 
		deathless’ and so on, but it was always ‘out there in the future’. I was 
		encouraged to make great effort to achieve the goal and to break through 
		those things that obstructed progress towards it. And even when the 
		words didn’t directly say that the goal was ‘out there’, that was the 
		message that I heard. Eventually I found myself in a terribly 
		frustrating knot. At one point I felt that my whole commitment to 
		practice was seriously challenged. Gratefully, with some help, I came to 
		realise that the struggle I was caught in was about the very feeling of 
		having to get somewhere. I had internalised a sense that I had to ‘fix’ 
		myself somehow, change what I was and get somewhere else. Clearly it 
		wasn’t working, so I gave up. In giving up I experienced a feeling like 
		that of beginning a journey home. What a relief! Just as I was beginning 
		to wonder if the journey itself was about to come to a sudden and sad 
		ending I felt I could settle into something perfectly natural. And with 
		this shift came a feeling, initially unnoticed, of being genuinely 
		personally responsible. This was new.<br>
		<br>
		From this experience I developed a practice characterised by a strong 
		sense of trusting in that which already exists. This was altogether 
		different from striving towards achieving some goal. The effort that 
		this new appreciation spontaneously called forth was ‘not seeking’. My 
		attention was – and is – looking and feeling in this moment; enquiring, 
		‘Where and when do I decide this situation is somehow inadequate or 
		wrong or lacking?’ I found that I was able to notice quite clearly when 
		I was imposing on life some notion of how it should be, thinking, ‘it 
		shouldn’t be this way, it should be that way’. My practice became that 
		of simply, but resolutely, being with this awareness. Now I refer to 
		this as source-oriented practice – in which a trusting heart intuits 
		that what we are looking for is right here, not anywhere else, not 
		somewhere out there. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Faulty Will</i><br>
		<br>
		Many of us start meditating with a faculty of will that is not doing its 
		job properly. In trying so hard and for so long to wilfully fix 
		ourselves up, we have abused the very faculty of will. If you abuse 
		alcohol for a period of years and become alcoholic, you can never again 
		have a social drink. In our case we have over-used the will. Now we 
		can’t help but habitually overdo it and interfere with everything that 
		happens. We often feel unable to simply receive a situation and gently 
		apply will to direct and guide attention. If we find something we think 
		is wrong we tend to automatically slam an opinion on it – that ‘it 
		shouldn’t be this way’, and then we set about wilfully trying to fix it.
		<br>
		<br>
		For those of us who suffer this dysfunction, engaging the will as the 
		primary tool of meditative effort just doesn’t work. Whereas, if we 
		disengage from willing and abide in a mode of trusting in that which 
		already exists, trusting in reality and truth, if we simply stop our 
		compulsive interfering, then an accurate and conscious appreciation of 
		that which already exists will reveal itself. <br>
		<br>
		If you follow a path of practice that is goal-oriented, you can expect 
		to have a clear concept of what you should be doing and where you should 
		be going. There will be appropriate actions to take for any obstacles 
		that you might encounter. But if your path of practice is 
		source-oriented it is not like this at all. Here you come to sit in 
		meditation and you might begin by checking bodily posture, making sure 
		the back is upright and the head is resting comfortably on the 
		shoulders, chest open, belly at ease; and then you sit there, bringing 
		into awareness the sense that you don’t know what you are doing. You 
		simply don’t know. All you know is that you are sitting there (and there 
		may be times when you can’t even be sure of that). You don’t hang on to 
		anything. But you do pay attention to watching the tendency of the mind 
		to want to fix things. You focus interest on the movement of the mind 
		towards taking sides, either for or against.<br>
		<br>
		Usually when I sit in meditation I do nothing. I assume a conscious 
		posture and simply observe what’s happening; maybe the mind is all over 
		the place thinking about the liquorice I had the other night at 
		somebody’s house, or about how it’s a pity the sun has gone in, or about 
		how I will be in Beijing this time next week, or about how the monks at 
		Harnham sent an e-mail asking whether they should use gloss paint for 
		the doors in the monastery kitchen, and so on. Such thoughts might be 
		going through my mind; they’re nonsense, but I do nothing with them. 
		Absolutely nothing, until I start to feel a little bit uncomfortable, 
		and then I watch to see where that discomfort is coming from. It is 
		always coming from the same place: ‘I shouldn’t be this way. I should be 
		... My mind should be clear, I shouldn’t be ...’ Once this movement is 
		identified, a settling occurs. When we identify that which takes us away 
		from our natural feeling of centredness, we come home. This is not the 
		same kind of effort one would be making in goal-seeking practice. <br>
		<br>
		<i>Knowing for yourself</i><br>
		<br>
		Most of us have a natural tendency to incline towards one of these two 
		orientations of effort. Some people are contented and confident when 
		they have a clear sense of the goal – that is where they are supposed to 
		be going. Without a clear idea of where they are going, they become 
		confused and anxious. Others, if they focus on the idea of a goal, end 
		up depressed, feeling like they are failing; trying to stop thinking, 
		they fail, trying to sit properly, trying to make themselves happy, 
		trying to be loving, trying to be patient, trying to be mindful, they 
		are always failing. What a terrible mistake! The worst disease of 
		meditators is trying to be mindful. Some quit, feeling they have been 
		wasting their time. However, if we realise that we don’t have to do 
		anything other than be present with an awareness of the tendencies of 
		the mind to take sides for or against, then we settle. <br>
		<br>
		These two orientations are not mutually exclusive. It is useful to 
		understand how each of them has particular merits at different stages of 
		practice. In the beginning, to build up some confidence, it is necessary 
		that we have a good grasp of techniques. Even though we may relate more 
		readily to source-oriented teachings and practices, if we haven’t yet 
		found a firm foundation on which to practise, or if we have found that 
		firm foundation but our life is very busy, it can still be appropriate 
		at times to make effort to exercise will and focus. <br>
		<br>
		I encourage people in the beginning to be very disciplined and to count 
		their breaths, one to ten, ten to one, every out-breath, one, two, 
		three, up to ten, ten, nine, eight, down to one, being quite precise in 
		the effort made. This way we get to know that our attention is indeed 
		our own. We are not slaves to, or victims of, our minds. If our 
		attention is wandering off and we get caught up in resentment or desire, 
		then we need to know that we are responsible for that. Our practice, 
		whether we are goal-oriented or source-oriented, is not going to 
		progress until we are clear that we are responsible for the quality of 
		attention with which we operate. <br>
		<br>
		To reach this perspective it may be necessary to exercise a rigorous 
		discipline of attention for a long period of time. Yet we may reach a 
		point at which we sense that in continuing to make this kind of effort 
		we need to refine the techniques and systems to pursue a goal. But if we 
		encounter a deep conviction that to do so is no longer appropriate, then 
		we need to be ready to adjust; to let go altogether of seeking anything. 
		If it is right for us to make this choice, then, when we hear someone 
		talking about their differing way of practice, we can say, ‘Oh, okay, 
		that’s fine.’ We won’t be shaken. It is really important that we don’t 
		keep letting ourselves be shaken by somebody else’s enthusiasm. <br>
		<br>
		As we settle more comfortably and confidently into making our own ‘right 
		effort’ it becomes easier to recognise the various strengths and 
		weaknesses of different styles of practice. In goal-oriented practice, 
		for example, it is probably easier to generate energy. With a clear 
		concept of what you are supposed to be doing, attention narrows, all 
		distractions are excluded, and you focus, focus, focus. By being so 
		exclusive, energy gathers; this way you readily observe yourself 
		progressing along the path. This in turn supports faith. As with 
		everything, there is a shadow side to this, which is directly related to 
		this strength. In being so exclusive you risk chopping out things that 
		could be useful or need to be addressed; there is a danger of denial. If 
		old neurotic habits of avoidance have not been addressed and you follow 
		a goal-seeker’s practice, then these tendencies become compounded. This 
		is the origin of fundamentalism. And despite popular belief there have 
		been, and there are now, Buddhist fundamentalists.<br>
		<br>
		One of the strengths of source-oriented practice is that as we release 
		out of the striving and the aiming for something other than 
		here-and-now, a balanced, whole body-mind relaxation emerges. And this 
		draws out our creativity. We have to be creative since by not excluding 
		anything, everything must be translated into practice. There is no 
		situation that is not a practice-situation. However, unwise creativity 
		can harbour delusion. If we are so happy and relaxed that we are getting 
		lazy or heedless with the precepts for example, then we need to 
		recognise what is going on. <br>
		<br>
		Another danger in source-oriented practice is that when we really do get 
		into a pickle we could feel disinclined to do anything about it. This 
		tends to happen because we no longer relate to structures in the way we 
		used to. Faith for us is inspired, not by a concept of what we hope lies 
		ahead, but by a sense that what we trust in is already essentially true. 
		However, if the clouds of fear and anger overshadow the radiance of our 
		faith we can tremble badly, and possibly even crumble. In this case it 
		is important that we have already cultivated spiritual friendship. To 
		have the blessing of association with others with whom we share a 
		commitment to conscious relationship is an incomparably precious 
		resource. When we gather in spiritual companionship, a special feeling 
		of relatedness is struck up in which we rightly feel safe. This relative 
		security can be for us what concepts and goals are for goal-striving 
		spiritual technicians. <br>
		<br>
		As we progress in our practice each of us has the task of checking to 
		see whether we are moving into or out of balance. But how do we assess 
		how things are moving? If we are moving into balance, it means we can 
		handle more situations, we can accommodate states of greater complexity. 
		If we are moving out of balance, it means we can handle fewer and fewer 
		situations: instead of spiritual practice liberating us and opening us 
		up to life, it makes us exclusive and painfully cut off.<br>
		<br>
		So it is wise to examine our practice and see if we can find in which 
		direction we feel we move most easily, which orientation of effort comes 
		most naturally to us, what sort of language works for us. We need to 
		prepare ourselves with the understanding that teachers of these 
		different approaches use different ways of talking. So listen to the 
		teachings you receive, contemplate that which you read in books, and see 
		which orientation of effort makes sense to you. Once you know, I suggest 
		you go with what inspires you.<br>
		<br>
		Hopefully you can see how this contemplation is an important part of our 
		contribution to the shared task of translating practice. May we all feel 
		encouraged to investigate the contribution we are making to this task at 
		this stage in its unfolding in the West. I am confident that our careful 
		enquiry will show up our weaknesses, individually and collectively, and 
		when we become quietly aware of our deficiencies we will become more 
		creative. We will be able translators of the practice. Adaptation will 
		happen where it is necessary and it will be in the service of Dhamma. 
		Possibly we won’t even notice it. We will just know that the spirit of 
		the Way is alive within us and that our hearts are more at ease. <br>
