		<i>Those who build canals channel the flow of water.<br>

		<br>
		Dhammapada Verse 80<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		The abbot of ‘The International Forest Monastery of Bung Wai’ had 
		expressed an interest in visiting our monasteries in Europe and spending 
		some time here on retreat. Everything was in place for this to happen 
		except there being someone to take over his duties during his absence. 
		After living in Britain for twelve years, I was interested to return to 
		Asia, so it was a joy when, in 1993, I found myself heading for Thailand 
		for an extended stay in the place where I had done most of my initial 
		training as a young monk.<br>
		<br>
		Twilight was falling by the time I once again entered the monastery 
		gates. Being greeted by old friends and new stirred feelings of 
		nervousness, gratitude and wonder. So much had happened both inwardly 
		and outwardly since I had lived there. The place was familiar and yet at 
		the same time different. The dark all-encompassing silence of the 
		forest, the fragrance of wild blossoms mingling with the scent of 
		burning incense, took me back to being twenty-four years old again, full 
		of hope for mystical experience and yet wonderfully empty of 
		expectations. But now electrical sounds drifted across the paddy fields 
		from the lit village of Bung Wai, where every house, not just the 
		headman’s, had its own television set and stereo. <br>
		<br>
		After a day or two I discovered that the monastery hadn’t changed too 
		much. Although the dirt road from Ubon, the regional town, had been 
		upgraded to tarmac, and mechanical rotavators had replaced the buffaloes 
		in the fields, the monastery water was still pulled by hand from the 
		well; leaves were still swept daily; dye for the robes was still made 
		with resin extracted by hard labour from the jackfruit tree; and reading 
		at night was still done by kerosene lamp-light. The message so 
		characteristic of the Theravadin forest tradition, ‘Keep It Simple’, 
		still sounded out, like the resonating temple gong heard for miles 
		around, even above the new and modern noise.<br>
		<br>
		The daily programme in the monastery was more flexible than I had 
		anticipated, so there was time to reconnect with the other resident 
		monks. There was also time to converse with local villagers. 
		Miraculously, they seemed to remember those of us who had lived there 
		when the monastery was founded in 1974. The older folk hadn’t kicked 
		their lifetime habit of chewing betel nut, nor had they lost their 
		radiant toothless smiles. We exchanged stories about developments in 
		monasteries around the world, some in countries that many of them had 
		not heard of. <br>
		<br>
		As fortune would have it, there was an opportunity during this period of 
		residence to visit some of the meditation masters of the north-east, 
		including my first teacher whom I hadn’t seen since leaving his 
		monastery eighteen years before. Venerable Ajahn Tate was a highly 
		respected teacher somewhat senior to Ajahn Chah and had been a disciple 
		of Ajahn Mun in the 1930s. Having become a monk at the age of fourteen, 
		his whole life had been spent earnestly in the practice and service of 
		the Dhamma. He grew to be – along with Ajahn Chah – one of the 
		pre-eminent leaders of Thai Buddhism, eventually establishing and living 
		at Hin Mark Peng monastery. At the time of my visit to Thailand, he was 
		residing in nearby Wat Tum Karm, the mountain cave monastery of the late 
		Ajahn Fun. I consider myself extremely fortunate to have spent the first 
		months of my monastic life with him, before I came to live under the 
		guidance of Venerable Ajahn Chah.<br>
		<br>
		When I first went to stay with Ajahn Tate he was seventy-four and had 
		recently been diagnosed with leukaemia. Eighteen years later, he was 
		miraculously still offering guidance to anyone who sought his help. So 
		with no small amount of joy and anticipation I joined the party 
		travelling the few hours north to pay their respects. ‘‘What shall I 
		give him? Will he remember me?” – such excited thoughts, memories about 
		the hard time I’d had in those early years, and a child-like 
		anticipatory delight filled my mind. <br>
		<br>
		Even at the time I’d lived with him he had had a beautiful grandfatherly 
		appearance. Now, at ninety-three, he had little physical strength left, 
		yet his eyes shone, his quiet high-pitched voice was clear and his skin 
		glowed. I choked with tears as I bowed in respect and gratitude. 
		Although normally I was quite able to communicate adequately in Thai, I 
		needed one of the other monks to express my intense joy at seeing him 
		again. He didn’t recognise me and it didn’t matter as I sat at his feet 
		again. “How amazing!” I thought to myself, “All those years ago, I 
		struggled so much in my new life as a forest monk, enduring the furious 
		inner fires, yet here I am feeling such happiness! How wonderful!”<br>
		<br>
		Ajahn Tate had been the meditation teacher of my preceptor Somdet 
		Nyanasamvara of Wat Bovornives in Bangkok, and I’d been introduced to 
		his teachings in the form of printed translations. When I happened to 
		meet some of Ajahn Tate’s disciples in Bangkok I was impressed by their 
		conduct and outward demeanour, and so, with the blessing of my 
		preceptor, I move up country to spend my first rains retreat (vassa) at 
		Wat Hin Mark Peng. I travelled there in the company of another western 
		monk I’d also met in Bangkok. We had coincidentally attended retreats 
		around the same time in Australia, and now shared the same interest in 
		spending time with this great teacher. Wat Hin Mark Peng was a remote 
		monastery on the forested banks of the Mekong River, about thirty miles 
		upstream from Vientiane, the capital of Laos. When I was there, the 
		communists were invading Laos. My kuti was high on a cliff, directly 
		above the river. When I first arrived we would go down to bathe each 
		morning, but as conditions between Thailand and Laos deteriorated, 
		Russian soldiers began patrolling the Mekong in their boats and there 
		was too much shooting going on for it to be comfortable to continue.<br>
		<br>
		Living in a war zone certainly added to the intensification of my 
		experience. I was already trying to adjust to the food and climate, and 
		I couldn’t speak the language either. Where I came from in New Zealand, 
		living in the forest was a treat – no snakes, scorpions or even ants to 
		be troubled by. But in the tropical forest of Asia real care needed to 
		be taken as you got into bed at night in case a snake hadn’t crawled in 
		there first. There were times when I would wake up in the middle of the 
		night with my body covered in stinging ants, and the walls of the hut 
		apparently moving as they teemed over the entire building.<br>
		<br>
		<i>The Heart and the Activity of the Heart</i><br>
		<br>
		On the occasion of the first interview my companion and I had with Ajahn 
		Tate, he was keen to hear about our practice. Since we were going to be 
		living in his monastery at least for the duration of the Rains Retreat, 
		he wanted to know what our understanding of practice was, so he called 
		us up to his kuti. <br>
		<br>
		After asking a few questions, he spoke to us for some time, during which 
		he said something that has stayed with me; something that still seems as 
		significant as it did then. Through the translator, he said, “Your task 
		in practice is to realise the difference between the heart and the 
		activity of the heart. It’s that simple.” As I recall this now, I can 
		almost hear him saying it; his voice gentle yet strong and full, clearly 
		rich in experience and unshakeable understanding. I hadn’t expected him 
		to say something so straightforward. I suppose I had expected something 
		more complex and difficult to understand, but my response when I heard 
		what he said was, “Yes, I get that, I can relate to that.”<br>
		<br>
		To observe inwardly, to direct attention so that we come to know 
		intimately for ourselves that which is the heart and that which is the 
		activity of the heart: this was and is the foundation of my meditation 
		practice and my enquiry. The words he used were jit and argarn kong jit. 
		Citta, a Pali word, is shortened in Thai to ‘jit’, and both words mean 
		‘heart’ or ‘mind’. Argarn kong jit means ‘the activity of the heart or 
		mind’.<br>
		<br>
		I had heard a lot of talk about developing jhanas – states of meditative 
		absorption – and about attaining different levels of realisation and 
		insight, but Ajahn Tate was pointing out that it is important not to be 
		distracted by ideas of practice nor by the various experiences, 
		sensations or mental impressions that we are subject to. We should view 
		them all simply as the activity of the mind. They are all the content of 
		the mind. If the heart or mind – the citta – is like an ocean, then the 
		activities of the heart or mind are like the waves on that ocean. Our 
		practice should consist in seeing these waves as waves, passing on the 
		surface of the ocean.<br>
		<br>
		Most of us are usually caught up in the activity. I still get caught up 
		in the waves, in the movements of mind, and I forget, I lose 
		perspective. Practice means remembering perspective, and cultivating an 
		awareness that distinguishes the knowing itself from that which is 
		known. We can know the sensations in the body; we can know feelings, 
		energetic movements, mental formations, ideas, impressions, concepts, 
		memories and fantasies. All these need to be known as activity. If we 
		don’t know them as activity, what happens? We become the activity and 
		get caught up in that activity. There is a poignant saying in Japanese 
		Buddhism: ‘Laugh, but don’t get lost in laughter; cry, but don’t get 
		lost in crying.’ We could also say, ‘Think, but don’t get lost in 
		thinking; enjoy, but don’t get lost in enjoyment.’ <br>
		<br>
		Sometimes people come across Buddhist teachings or Buddhist meditation 
		and they get the idea that peacefulness means getting rid of all the 
		content of the mind, making the mind empty. In meditation it sometimes 
		appears that the mind is very open and spacious and that there’s very 
		little happening. However, this does not mean that we’ve made it, that 
		we’re enlightened. In that state of openness, clarity and spaciousness, 
		we might experience vitality and pleasure, and if we’re not properly 
		informed and prepared, we can make the mistake of thinking ‘This is it! 
		This good feeling is the point of it all.’ Ajahn Tate was saying that 
		even this good feeling is also just the activity of the heart. The point 
		of practice is to know this activity in relation to that in which the 
		activity is taking place. What is it in which this activity is taking 
		place? What is it that knows? We should cultivate an awareness that 
		knows the knowing as well as that which is known.<br>
		<br>
		<i>The Effort to Remember</i><br>
		<br>
		This teaching was the first gift I received from Ajahn Tate, a precious 
		gift, and one that very much set me up for the practice that I have 
		followed ever since. I was an enthusiastic beginner who’d had a bit of 
		pleasurable experience in meditation. I was determined to get somewhere 
		in my practice and I made a huge amount of effort. After having got up 
		early in the morning and gone out on alms-round I would eat the one meal 
		and, after a rest, spend the rest of the day sitting and walking. There 
		were few books in English there, but the few I could find I reflected on 
		seriously. The little talking I could do was with people whose language 
		I couldn’t speak. The other Western monk was meditating on death, an 
		object of meditation frequently recommended by the Buddha and favoured 
		in the forest tradition, and he didn’t seem to want to pay much 
		attention to me. As it happened, as the months went by, I looked more 
		and more like death myself, and I think he began to find me an 
		interesting object of contemplation. I hadn’t been getting on very well 
		with the diet of sticky rice, pickled fish and chillies, and I lost a 
		lot of weight. But I’d committed myself to stay for the three months of 
		the vassa, and that commitment added to the intensity.<br>
		<br>
		I certainly experienced some benefits from the effort I made during this 
		retreat period of intensified practice. About halfway through the three 
		months, I had an experience of clarity that I can remember vividly – it 
		was a night or two before my twenty-fourth birthday. It was quite 
		spontaneous; I wasn’t doing any special practice. I was sitting there in 
		puja one evening, surrounded by the other monks. Puja took place in a 
		very basic, unattractive, open-sided wooden building with the usual 
		grass mats rolled out over the polished concrete floor. We chanted in 
		the same way as every other day, with the same mosquitoes biting and my 
		knees hurting as they usually did. Suddenly, without warning, I found 
		myself experiencing the most wonderful clarity – unlike anything I had 
		ever known before. I experienced an utterly natural yet at the same time 
		extraordinary sense of well-being. It seemed as though this perspective 
		on things should now last forever, because, in reality, things had 
		always been that way, only I hadn’t noticed it. When puja finished I 
		felt so elevated that I mentioned it to one of the other monks, and he 
		said, “Let’s go and speak to Ajahn Tate about it.”<br>
		<br>
		There was a tradition in the monastery that eight or ten monks would go 
		and see Ajahn Tate after evening chanting and massage him, all at the 
		same time. Thai massage is gruesome. You dig your elbows in as deeply as 
		you can. Those Thai monks would really get to work on Ajahn Tate. 
		Somebody would be on his foot, someone else on his leg, someone else on 
		an arm, all digging away. He’d go through this every night. On this 
		particular evening, as we talked about what had happened to me, he 
		stopped the massage, sat up and said, “I want to hear more about this.” 
		So I explained what I had experienced. That evening he gave me what I 
		consider the second most helpful piece of advice that I’ve ever received 
		on practice.<br>
		<br>
		He said, “These moments of clarity, this mindfulness and presence that 
		you have experienced, are very good. From now on what you have to do in 
		your practice is just to remember like this more quickly.” We were 
		talking through a translator, which wasn’t easy. If we’d been speaking 
		directly, he might have said, “Keep exercising mindfulness in the moment 
		and learn to come back sooner to this clear way of seeing. It’s that 
		simple – make the effort to remember.” Little by little, with the right 
		kind of effort, with consistent practice, as I am sure many of you have 
		realised, we can make a difference.<br>
		<br>
		It was not for another seven years until, wrapped in a blanket during a 
		winter retreat in England, that I was able to acknowledge more fully the 
		relevance of what Ajahn Tate had said that evening. After that 
		conversation I had fallen into hell. The profound, amazing experience I 
		had had during that evening had soon been followed by horrendously 
		unpleasant mind states, indescribably terrible states of self-doubt. 
		This is why I often speak about how important it is to prepare oneself 
		properly for practice. At that time I hadn’t long been off the hippy 
		trail. Only a few months before my time with Ajahn Tate I had left the 
		commune in which I’d been living and had hitchhiked across the 
		Australian desert. After that, I island-hopped through Indonesia, 
		stopping for a little diving in Timor, batik-painting in Java, and then 
		went on up through various beach resorts and restaurants in Malaysia to 
		Thailand. And then, I found myself with a shaved head and in robes, 
		doing this intensive practice. I definitely wasn’t properly prepared.<br>
		<br>
		Thanks to Ajahn Tate’s loving-kindness and consistent caring attention, 
		I survived those very unpleasant states. But it was about seven years 
		before I was able more fully to appreciate what he’d told me on that 
		occasion. Now I encourage people to make this effort to remember. 
		Sometimes, when we forget what we have learned, we can devalue 
		experiences that we’ve had, effort we’ve made, insights that have 
		arisen. Ajahn Chah had an image for this. He’d say, “These moments of 
		mindfulness and understanding are like drips of water coming out of a 
		tap. In the beginning it’s drip – drip – drip, with big gaps between the 
		drips.” If we’re heedless during those gaps, if we’re caught up in our 
		thinking, caught up in the content of the mind and the sensations we are 
		experiencing, we can think that our mindful moments were invalid and 
		dismiss them as accidents. But Ajahn Chah said, “Little by little, with 
		consistent effort, these moments become drip, drip, drip then 
		dripdripdrip and then they become a stream.” With constant effort, you 
		enter a continuous stream of mindfulness. The moments themselves are the 
		same, but they’re uninterrupted.<br>
		<br>
		We forget, but the good news is that we can remember. We sit in formal 
		meditation, gathering our hearts and mind together, and we settle into 
		stillness. We gain perspective, we remember. The mind wanders off. ‘If 
		only I hadn’t done that,’ we think; or, ‘Why did they say that?’ We 
		wander into the future, thinking, ‘Have I got my ticket for tomorrow? 
		Where did I put it?’ We get caught up, we get lost, but then we remember 
		because our hearts are committed to remembering. If we simply remember, 
		that’s good, but if we come in with some sort of judgement and say, ‘I 
		shouldn’t have forgotten my practice is hopeless,’ then we’ve lost it 
		again. Remembering is the point. We don’t need to dwell on our 
		forgetting.<br>
		<br>
		<i>Being Careful</i><br>
		<br>
		Ajahn Tate’s advice was, “All you’ve got to do is remember more 
		quickly.” I kept making an effort during that vassa and I was very 
		diligent, although by this time I was in such a state of despair, 
		occasional terror, distress and thorough unpleasantness, that it was 
		really just a question of survival. At the end of the vassa I wasn’t 
		well at all. They decided I needed to go down to Bangkok for a medical 
		check-up and to rest. In fact I ended up in hospital. I saw Ajahn Tate 
		before I left and he gave me a third significant and helpful teaching. 
		He gave it with such kindness and wisdom; he wasn’t just being nice to 
		me. He was so aware of the nature of this path. He said, “Be careful.” I 
		still remember this vividly. He said, “The place you are at within 
		yourself is very vulnerable – take care.”<br>
		<br>
		I often begin our evening meditation at Ratanagiri by guiding us 
		together into our inner settling by saying, “Carefully paying 
		attention…” I think in many cases we could substitute the word 
		‘carefulness’ for ‘mindfulness.’ In the poor condition that I was in 
		when I saw Ajahn Tate, his words were just what was needed. I was so 
		unhappy that I could very easily have been unkind to myself, or 
		heedless. You know what it’s like when you get a little miserable; you 
		start blaming, thinking, ‘Well, someone has done something wrong.’ It’s 
		very difficult to feel unhappy without feeling that somebody, probably 
		including oneself, has done something wrong.<br>
		<br>
		If we are feeling unhappy, what is called for is a willingness to simply 
		be with that unhappiness. If we’re not careful, we say something’s 
		wrong, though it doesn’t really help to say that. We say it either 
		inwardly or outwardly. This projecting of blame is a consequence of 
		having made an inner mistake of misperceiving our unhappiness, sadness 
		or suffering as being something wrong. We don’t receive it just as it 
		is. We don’t acknowledge it and feel it, allowing it to happen; we don’t 
		have the ‘knowingness’ to see it as activity taking place in awareness. 
		Because we don’t have that perspective, we struggle to do something 
		about our suffering, to deal with it in some way. To say that something 
		has gone wrong and that it’s somebody’s fault is a heedless way of 
		dealing with our unpleasant experiences. The habit of consistently doing 
		this is a symptom of what I call the compulsive judging mind. Ajahn 
		Tate’s parting gift to me, ‘be careful,’ alerted me to this, intuitively 
		if not conceptually. <br>
		<br>
		<i>One-Pointedness of Mind</i><br>
		<br>
		I received a final teaching from Ajahn Tate on the occasion of visiting 
		him with the group from Bung Wai in 1993. Only a few months later he 
		passed away, at the age of ninety-four. We sat close to him so he didn’t 
		have to speak loudly. I felt almost too ashamed to attempt to engage him 
		in talk since he seemed so frail and tired; just to be near him was 
		enough. Yet with visibly keen interest and with great kindness he 
		responded to the questions he was asked. All the other visitors of the 
		day had departed; only our small group remained. As I recall, one of the 
		young monks asked Ajahn Tate if he could identify the essence of 
		Buddhist teaching. “Buddhism, you want a definition of Buddhism?” he 
		said. “Buddhism is one-pointedness of mind.” (Thai: ekaggata jit). A lot 
		has been written and said about Buddhism, and that such a great being 
		should give such a clear and simple presentation of the path was a 
		precious gift.<br>
		<br>
		For those who don’t yet have a foundation in practice it would be 
		understandable if Ajahn Tate’s definition of Buddhism didn’t make sense. 
		Even for those who do, for the most part we don’t yet know how to abide 
		clearly, consciously and mindfully in a state of one-pointedness. If we 
		do have an appreciation of one-pointedness, even to a small degree, then 
		we will know that a mind that is distracted and fragmented is a mind 
		that is confused and which misperceives the way things are. In this 
		condition the natural well-being that we feel when there is one-pointedness 
		is obstructed. <br>
		<br>
		Many of us went through years of our early lives being chronically 
		obstructed. We were trying to sort out the right philosophy, the right 
		political statement, the right lifestyle, the right type of 
		relationship, the right social arrangement, so that we would feel good 
		about life. It wasn’t until my first meditation retreat, during which I 
		learned to focus attention on the breath and to inhibit the tendency to 
		follow distractions that I discovered, or uncovered, the natural state 
		of well-being that comes when the mind is concentrated. Up until that 
		point I thought I had to do something or imbibe something to feel good. 
		When we remember or reconnect with the natural goodness of the heart – 
		which is still, calm, peaceful and clear – then, through seeing clearly 
		the nature of the world, our relationship with the world is changed. The 
		world remains what it is and what it has always been. There is still 
		pleasure and pain, both intense and mediocre. There’s still injustice 
		and struggle, disappointment, joy, delight and happiness. But when we 
		see with clarity that all of this comes and goes, when we see with 
		awareness all of experience arising and ceasing, we no longer, from 
		conditioned preference, invest ourselves in any experience in 
		particular. We invest instead in understanding the nature of experience.<br>
		<br>
		So the fourth teaching from Ajahn Tate that I recall is that what is 
		really worth developing is not a sophisticated understanding of Buddhist 
		theory or lots of retreat experiences and insights but an appreciation 
		of how to abide more freely and more frequently with one-pointedness of 
		heart and mind. When we know this state and it is rightly focused on the 
		Way we will be best placed to progress in practice.<br>
		<br>
		For these four simple yet wonderfully relevant teachings I will remain 
		eternally indebted to Ajahn Tate and I am happy to share them with you.
