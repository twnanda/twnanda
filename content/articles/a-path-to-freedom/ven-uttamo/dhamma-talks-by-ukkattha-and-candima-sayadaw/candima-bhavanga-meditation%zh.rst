       	The practice on (?? of ??) bhavaṅga meditation is killing taṇhā by suppression (vikkhambhana) from bodily pain (kāyika-dukkha-vedanā). [?? The practice of bhavaṅga meditation is to kill taṇhā by suppressing (vikkhambhana) pain in the body (kāyika-dukkha-vedanā). ??] Here is not using ānāpānasati practice to make the mind feels comfort at the tip of the nostril (i.e., get into samādhi). [?? Here it is not ānāpānasati practice to make the mind feel comfortable at the tip of the nose (i.e., to enter samādhi). ??] Bhavaṅga is called the clear element of the mind. (?? Bhavaṅga is known as the element of clarity of mind. ??) This clear mind element exists at the heart-base, a cavity situated within the physical heart (i.e., in the small amount of blood). This is the birthplace of mind and mental factors (cetasika). It is also the place which connects the mind to the kammic wind element (kammaja-vāyo) of the physical body (rūpa-kāya). The mind wants to move the great elements of the rūpa-kāya or to move the physical body, it has to stimulate from the bhavaṅga to connect them. When the four great elements of the rūpa-kāya are strongly afflicted, the mind element sends the taste (rasa) of the coarse undesirable object from the body contact to the bhavaṅga. And then feeling (vedanā) with mind consciousness arise from the bhavaṅga to experience the taste of the object. The mind with diṭṭhi connects to dukkha vedanā and suffer with pain, unpleasantness, etc., and it continues to increase the mental states of don’t want to experience (dosa) and want to correct it for comfort (lobha). At that time the heart area where the mind relies on becomes tense, but the worldlings don’t know this nature. When the physical body has injuries or affliction, the mind suffers. And then with the deadly affliction it becomes very painful. Now practice is teaching the yogis how to exercise to strip off the mind contacts (mano samphassa) from connection with mind and form (the physical body). [?? The practice now is to teach the yogi how to exercise, stripping the mind contact (mano samphassa) from the connection with the mind and the form (body). ??]  With the cessation of mind contact and feeling (vedanā) ceases—mano samphassa nirodha vedanā nirodho; with the cessation of craving and pain ceases. With the cessation of pain (suffering) realize the truth of cessation—nirodha sacca which is nibbāna by suppression (vikkhambhana pahāna). The practice is separated into two parts—such as contemplation with lying down posture and sitting posture. It can be practiced with any postures after understanding with the success of the exercise (i.e., continue with the practice to abandon diṭṭhi-taṇhā). It’s teaching you able to put down the bhavaṅga and able to separate mind and the body. (?? It teaches you to be able to let go of the "bhavaṅga" and to be able to separate the mind from the body. ??) If you are able to separate them like this, you can contemplate and develop whatever arises one’s meditation object—such as contemplation on mind, 32 parts of the body (as e.g., skeleton, bones etc.) and the four great elements, etc. If you succeed in this practice, do not be afraid of dying. Because you are able to separate the mind from the body which can oppress to death and the mind contacting (mano samphassa) to the mind becomes disjoined and suffering ceased and die with peace. [?? Because you are able to separate the mind from the body, and this body presses to death, the contact of the mind with the mind contact (mano samphassa) becomes irrelevant; and the suffering ceases and dies in a peaceful way. ??] 
     	In this Dhamma practice when the four great elements afflicted the yogi who has a worldling habit which stimulates the mind to change the body accordingly by tensing the heart. (?? In this Dhamma practice, when the four elements afflict the yogi with worldly habits; it stimulates the mind and changes the body accordingly by tensing the heart. ??) At that time the yogi should wait to contemplate to see the non-self nature of the preceding mind with taṇhā and dosa which asking to tense the heart. Do not let the following mind arise to change or adjust the physical body with success. Practice by letting go of the desire mind. The yogi has to put full effort by practicing with patience and endurance to abandon the desire to change the physical body (here are two important factors to overcome it, i.e., sati and khanti). [?? There are two important factors to overcome it here, namely mindfulness (sati) and forbearance (khanti) ??].
     	
     	P2
     	At that time mind contact (mano-samphassa) can’t incline toward the body and the mind with lobha and dosa (i.e., wanting to change or move and unbearable) are extinguished (by suppression) or bhavaṅga falls off, and the mind becomes peaceful. And however the body is painful, the mind not pain. (?? And no matter how painful the body may be, the mind is painless. ??) This is dependent arising (paṭiccasamuppāda) machine stops. The mind frees from the taṇhā bondage of wanting to change or correct the physical body. When practicing this way with lying down posture the bhavaṅga falls off and the mind is in clear state, the yogi himself sees the physical body and the mind are not connected and each by its own (this kind of experience made some people taking the mind as a soul, in meditation or hypnotized state). It was like the yogi himself sees someone sleeping beside him when he is sitting there. (?? It is like the yogi himself sitting there and seeing someone sleeping next to him. ??) He himself was seeing the physical body breathe in and out by itself. (?? He himself sees the flesh breathe itself and exhale itself. ??) The yogis continue the practice which was mentioned in the recorded disc. 
     	(This short talk was an introduction to the bhavaṅga meditation. Later he gave two hours each to his yogis in his center for lying down and sitting meditation with this method. I will explain them in gist in the following.)
     	A yogi falls into bhavaṅga when he gets up has to be careful. The mind and the body are not connected, so he becomes worried about it. What will happen to me? It’s frightening. What happened to me? He becomes worried and concerned about it. (This experience relates to lying down posture). But don’t worry about it. It was possible, like someone during his sleep possessed by a spirit and could not move the body after woke up. (?? This could be like someone who is possessed by a ghost in his sleep and wakes up unable to move his body. ?? OR It was possible, like someone who was possessed by a spirit during his sleep and could not move the body after waking up.  ??)
     	(This kind of experience happened to me many years ago in a Thai forest monastery, which was a ghost haunted place. One day I was not well and lying down in my kuti and fell asleep. It was nighttime and suddenly I woke up and could not get up or move my body. (?? It was during the night when I suddenly woke up, unable to get up or move my body. ??)  So I recited the mantra Buddho!  For sometimes and later could get up. (?? After a while, I was able to get up. ?? ) )
     	If the yogi becomes like this he has to breathe ānāpāna slowly and regularly non-stop and gripping and stretching the fingers of both hands, curving and stretching both elbows, moving the toes of both legs, curving and stretching both knees slowly. After the blood and air circulate the whole body, turn to the left side and get up slowly. During the lying down meditation, not letting others come and wake you up by calling and moving you. This point has to be careful. Yogis continue the practice according to the instruction.
     	
     	Explanation on the bhavaṅga meditation:
     	Actually this way of practice is not much different from the diamond meditation (mahāpallaṅka kammaṭṭhāna) which has been described before. The differences are only the ways of development of samādhi. The former one develops strong samādhi with ānāpānasati and with this samādhi develops insight with contemplation on the mind (cittānupassanā). This practice is direct using cittānupassanā to develop samādhi and insight without using other objects for samādhi separately. 
     	With sati the yogi has to watch and observe whatever arising mind state from the bhavaṅga (mano). In this practice there is no primary object (e.g., the breath) to contemplate because there is always a mind that arises and without it, it will die.
     	
     	P3
     	Here it’s contemplating the mind and mind state only. If physical sensation and pain arise, sati mind is not inclining toward any bodily part where it arises. Only contemplate the preceding mind which knows the sensation with the following sati mind. It’s the same as in the ānāpānasati sutta it did not mention the place of the sensation, just only established mindfulness in front (to the fore) of him. Here the important point is the yogi practicing to separate the body from the mind, where kilesa is latent in it. (?? The important point here is that the yogi practices separating the body from the mind in which the kilesa lurks. ??) So when the yogi contemplates the mind objects, he also does not incline sati to the place where (i.e., bhavaṅga) it arise. Here not concern anything with the body. If concern about it when severe pain arises can’t bear it and easily effect the bhavaṅga, taṇhā comes in to correct the physical body. With sati, patience and endurance (here means only sati, but it includes the other path factors) combat taṇhā not to affect the mind and at last taṇhā dies out. [?? With sati, patience and endurance (here only sati, but also other path factors), combat with taṇhā; so that it does not affect the mind, and finally taṇhā disappears. ??]
     	The instruction on bhavaṅga meditation is nearly the same as diamond meditation. So the reader should go back to the instructions mentioned there. The system is simple, but the practice is not easy, especially for two hours or three hours sitting. The yogi needs a lot of patience and endurance to deal with pains and difficulties. In the instruction, when pains arise, do not allow changing or moving the physical body, even not allow tensing or contracting the bhavaṅga. Therefore, Sayadaw asks the yogis to practice first with the lying down posture because it’s easy to maintain the physical posture easily than the sitting for longer period. (?? Therefore, Sayadaw asks yogis to practice lying down first because it is easier to maintain the body's posture than sitting for long periods of time. ??) Sayadaw gave two instructions for two hours each for both. It was encouraged and reminded the yogis not to react to pains and relaxed in body and mind, and for a correct posture. After with the lying posture, the yogis know the practice and also become easy for the sitting.
     	Here I will give some points mentioned in the lying posture instruction, and the sitting posture instruction is not much different from it. In Sayadaw’s teaching he always emphasizes the importance of posture, it could come from his long hours sitting experiences (see his autobiography). It should be a natural posture without any tension of the whole body in a relaxed way and without any control with the mind to the body. So he asks the yogis to check and relax any part of the body part by part, from the tips of the toe to the head. After that, the whole body is relaxed and ease and leaving it like a doll there. (?? After the whole body is relaxed and relieved, let it be there like a doll. ??) Do not to move, change or concern anything about it and the mind and the body separate temporarily. He gives the example of a string puppet—the hands control the strings is like the mind and taṇhā, the strings are nerves of the body and the puppet or doll is the physical body. When the hands let go of the strings and the doll separates from the hands, the doll stays by itself. The body is lying down on the floor by itself, and we may think the mind can be taken as self (atta). He asked the yogis if they could stop the mind, not thinking anything by itself. It was impossible to stop thoughts, mental objects to arise by itself one by one without end. (?? He asked the yogis if they could stop the mind and not think anything on their own. He said, "It is impossible to stop thinking; mental objects will arise one after another by themselves, without end." ??) This is its nature. This is the resultant kammic khandha arises by past kamma until it’s finished for this life (see the 12 links of the D. A. process—avijjā → saṅkhāra → viññāṇa). In this instruction, he used quite a few times with the D. A. process to explain them. We can see the importance of D. A. teaching in the practice. Mogok Sayādawgyi's teaching on the D. A. is very important for yogis and Buddhists. 
     	The yogis observe with sati and see the inconstant nature of mind and mental state arise one by one and its non-self nature (anatta). He said that this is not insight practice yet. After practicing for some time, pains will arise from the body. (?? After practicing for a period of time, the body will experience pain. ??) Its nature (i.e., rūpa or ruppati means—oppressed, afflicted, etc. It undergoes and imposes alteration owing to adverse physical conditions) is dukkha.
     	
     	
     	P4
     	The yogi has to contemplate the pain knowing the mind and not on the body where it arises. (Here the yogi has to be careful not to pay any attention to any part of the body). If the pain becomes stronger, taṇhā comes in and wanting to change the body or correct the body for its comfort. The yogi should not give in and follow desire with patience and endurance, contemplate its anatta nature. (?? A yogi should not give in and follow his desires; he should contemplate with patience and endurance the nature of anatta. ??) Khandha arises is sakkāya if become unbearable and take it as my pain become sakkāya diṭṭhi, it will stimulate the mind and volition (cetanā) or kamma arises to change or move the body. [?? Rising up with khandha is sakkāya. If it becomes unbearable and takes it as my pain, it becomes sakkāya diṭṭhi; it will stimulate the mind and volition (cetanā) or kamma to arise, in terms of changing or moving the body. ??] Then paṭiccasamuppāda continues. Sayadaw urged the yogis not to give in and give up to taṇhā. If you give in to taṇhā, you will die again and again in saṁsāra and never end. (In battling with taṇhā, yogi will never die. We die because of allowing taṇhā killing us.) Even the bodhisatta before his enlightenment practicing to utmost with patience and endurance and the body became like a skeleton and not died (i.e., with wrong practices by torturing oneself). Noble warriors will never die, and only ignoble warriors will die forever—i.e., worldlings. Once, Loong Por Cha said as follows—If you feed a tiger in a cage every day, it will become stronger and stronger and at last it will kill you. Here also the yogis feed the taṇhā tiger every-time asking for its desire and taṇhā becomes stronger and stronger out of control. (?? Here, also, the yogis are feeding the desire of the taṇhā tiger whenever it demands it; thus the taṇhā becomes stronger and stronger, so that it cannot be controlled. ??)
     	(Now we can see this in today's world. There are a lot of human problems going on from politics, economics, environmental problems—such as all sorts of pollution, climate change with many disasters. Instead of solving these important issues together, some leaders and governments are finding faults, quarrelling and fighting each other. The world becomes an unpleasant place.)
     	If these two enemies diṭṭhi and taṇhā combine, it becomes destructive. He can’t bear the pain and follow taṇhā and change or move the body which conditions a new khandha. Not following taṇhā and become taṇhā nirodho nibbānam—taṇhā dies out. (?? If you do not follow taṇhā, and it gradually disappears to extinction, that is nibbāna (taṇhā nirodho—nibbānam). ??) In one of Mogok Sayadawgyi’s talk on Nandakovāda Sutta (MN 146), he said that it was better to cut off taṇhā directly. Bhavaṅga meditation is cutting off taṇhā directly. After taṇhā ceases, bhavaṅga fall off and the mind is clear and peaceful. The yogi sees the physical body and the mind are not connected, and each one is by itself. This is purification of the mind (citta-visuddhi). Some yogis have skeleton nimitta, some discern the four elements, and some continue to contemplate the mind. Contemplation with samādhi power becomes insight (vipassanā).
     	In one of Sayadaw Candima’s talks—Living, Dying and Future, he mentioned the following incident. A female disciple’s brother was near death with cancer in a hospital. This young man was in agony with pain and crying. She requested Sayadaw’s help, and he went to the hospital to see him. He instructed him with teaching and meditation. Sayadaw did not mention what he taught him. I was quite sure that it was not ānāpānasati because he was in a serious condition with some blood transfusion and oxygen to his body. It was quite possible that Sayadaw taught him bhavaṅga meditation in lying posture, as mentioned above. It was more suitable for the situation. After four days of diligent practice, he overcame the pain and later died peacefully,  leaving a body which was soft and pliable. Before his death, the elder sister went to see him. He showed his upright thumb to her not to worry about him. When a person was drowning, he would grasp anything near him. In the same way, a yogi in near death will apply full effort in the practice, nothing is important and reliable for him any more except Dhamma. 
     	
     	P5
     	There was a documentary film on death and dying from China. It included some death of old people. Some had difficult and unpleasant dying in hospitals with life supporting machines. Some old people who were Buddhist yogis dying with their faces in peace and smile (most of them could be Pure Land practicers). In there, a beautiful actress died with cancer in a hospital, and before she died saw ghosts on the ceiling. She died with fright and her face was in grimace looked like ghost. Her skin color liked ashen color the whole body was stiff and tense, especially the fingers and toes were stiff and crooked, and her body was emanciated (?? emaciated ??). She left behind a big house and wealth to her husband without children. The man also did not dare to stay in the house. 
     	Living, dying and the future—these three matters are very important for everyone. We are not in this human world just for pleasure, wasting time and doing foolish and stupid things. If our dying are not good, future births are also very bad. Human births are very rare. It is very important for everyone to prepare for his or her dying. It seems to me Sayadaw U Candima’s teaching on bhavaṅga meditation is very good for that. It is most likely that everyone will die in a lying posture. Therefore, we should use the lying posture exercise as mentioned above. 
     	
     	
     	A Postscript
     	
     	In Thae-inn Gu Sayadaw’s teachings, I don’t include his meditation instruction to yogis. So here I want to describe in gist from his many talks. We also will know why U Candima had difficulty in his own practice by following it. At the time when he was followsing the system had no knowledge about anything on Dhamma. Thae-inn Gu Sayadaw’s practice is not much different from Soon Loon Sayadaw’s practice because he used the book about him and the practice. One time a very senior and well known Taung Tha Sayadawgyi requested Soon Loon Sayadaw to write the practice of ānāpānasati for him in gist was as follows—
     	Even though taṇhā could be cut off from the eye door etc. by watching, but with touching, knowing and sati by watching at the body door to cut off taṇhā is easy to develop the strong view of mind-body knowledge (nāma-rūpa ñāṇa). At the body door contact (phassa) arises; condition by contact and feeling arises (vedanā); from feeling not let it become craving (taṇhā), clinging (upādāna) and becoming (bhava) by cutting it off with mindfulness (sati)—i.e., at feeling. If cut off taṇhā in this way vedanā not become vedanā saññā instead it becomes vedanā paññā.
     	 This part of the instruction in the letter. Soon Loon Sayadaw wrote it from the beginning of ānāpānasati up to path and fruition mind states. Thae-inn Gu Sayadaw did not have much education and knowledge. So his style of teaching is very simple and like a fixed formula. His voice and language had strength and energy, very direct and blunt.
     	“ ??   Take ānāpānasati, the mind has to know the air of in and out pressure. (?? In the case of ānāpānasati, for example, the mind must know the pressure of the incoming and outgoing air. ??) Breathe naturally and following the nature of knowing. Near death, the four elements will kill you. There are 40 samatha objects. There are physical form  (ārammaṇa kammaṭṭhāna), loathsomeness (asubha kammaṭṭhāna), form  (rūpa kammaṭṭhāna), mind kammaṭṭhāna. Just know the in and out pressure (air). Don’t think anything. After sometime with the sitting contact to the hard floor, phassa → vedanā arises. [?? After a period of sitting contact with a hard floor (phassa →), vedanā arises. ??] Mind and body of people are not the same, in the same way, their dhammas are different. From mind kammaṭṭhāna, form kammaṭṭhāna and ārammaṇa kammaṭṭhāna can become sotāpanna. In your past life, if you had practiced ārammaṇa kammaṭṭhāna before, physical objects will arise (in the mind)—such as red color, yellow color, forest and mountain, etc. These are arising by changing. Only you can give the right concept (paññatti) to discern the paramatā. (?? Only if you can give the correct concept (paññatti) can you discern the paramatā. ??) So you must give the right concept. How to contemplate it? Contemplate form (rūpa) as changing nature. Don’t give the concepts of red, green, yellow, etc. If you do it and connect to vedanā, contemplate the nature of form as changing and dissolution. You can see each one of them is changing (i.e., not changing into something—each one arises and disappears). Don’t know them as—green, yellow, blue, etc. 
     	In the past, if you had practiced an asubha object, asubha nimitta will arise. The acquired sign (parikamma nimitta) arises in the mind. If you practiced skeleton before, now skeleton will arise (Sayadaw also talked about other asubha nimittas). Don’t be afraid of it. These are your Dhamma inheritance of the past. Some people talked about them as concepts. They didn’t know the differences between concept and reality (paramatā). These are the results of past kammas. If seeing asubha in this life, you will go to Nibbāna (i.e., can finish the practice like him). It kills taṇhā directly. Don’t let it disappear. Contemplate its nature. How does it appear? For example, the fresh body changes slowly stage by stage—becoming brown and black in color, flowing out with putrid blood and pus, the body becomes bloated, etc. Observe its nature. How does it change and dissolve? You will see its nature. Seeing, hearing, smelling, etc. are dhamma. You don’t need to argue about it. Don’t be afraid of the putrid, bloated corpses which are upādānakkhandha of the mind. You’ll see the whole world as asubha (as in his own practice).
     	With nāma (mind) kammaṭṭhāna from the internal, the affliction of the four elements arise. The elements’ nature of earth, water, heat, air arise. If the earth element arises first, it’ll kill you (i.e., at death). When the earth element arises, the mind knows it as stiffness (i.e., concept). You have to change it as affliction of form (rūpa) and feeling (vedanā). Don’t know its nature of stiffness. Contemplate it as afflicted form and feeling, again feeling is nāma (mind). And then know the nature of nāma. What is the task of nāma? Nāma nature is that it feels (experience) and dissolves. Don’t take it as stillness and tenseness. If you make it, vedanā connects taṇhā. You will be not free from apāya (woeful existences) if you take it as painful. Instead you have to know it as afflicted form and feeling. This is knowing the mind and form. Feeling is mind (nāma) dhamma. What is the natural characteristic of nāma? Its nature is feeling and dissolution. In this way, know all the bodily sensation as the feeling of the mind, which feels and dissolves. All these continuous knowing of them come to the end (i.e., following the ending of feelings). This is nāma kammaṭṭhāna you have to put effort in one sitting to free from apāya. You contemplate with the five powers (bala) of faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom—saddha, viriya, sati, samādhi and paññā. You must know these minds.
     	
     	P7
     	1. Mind with faith: I’ll do what the teacher asks me, even if my bones and skin are worn out. If I die, then let me die. If I don’t die, then let me attain Dhamma. I’ll not get up from sitting. In this way will realize the four truths. You’ll not attain it if you are groaning with pain and stop it. I am asking you for temporary dying exercise. You have to practice it to become habitual. This is practicing for dying. If not a hundred thousand humans die, no-one becomes human again. Why is that? Because you’ll designate it as I (i.e., self). If someone dies by wriggling his body on bed, he will not become human again because of dying with the wrong view. 
     	2. Mind with effort: From the beginning of the world this mind goes out external and feels the objects, mostly to experience pleasant feelings. You put effort into not letting the mind go out. (?? You have to put in the effort and not let the mind go out. ??) This is mind effort. The Buddha only taught about the mind. 
     	3. Mind with sati: You must always keep sati in mind. If stiffness arises, don’t know it as stiffness. Know it as the afflicted form (rūpa) with vedanā. Vedanā is nāma dhamma. Because I am worried that you will know them as stiffness, tenseness, etc.  Sati supports the mind not to become unwholesome mind and become wholesome mind (akusala citta and kusala citta). [?? Sati supports the mind so that it does not become an unwholesome mind (akusala citta) but a wholesome mind (kusala citta). ??]
     	4. Samādhi mind: The mind does not change and only knows one.
     	5. Pañña mind: Mind (nāma) nature is feeling and dissolution and knowing this is wisdom or knowledge mind.
     	
     	Vipassanā yogis are free from apāyas by knowing the mind in this way, if not far from it. The Buddha also had done this work. Doing this work only becomes the Buddha’s children. (?? You can become a child of Buddha by doing only this work. ??)  The truths of seeing the mind, seeing form and seeing objects (ārammaṇas)—these are seeing the truths by stages. These also called the truths of sotāpanna, sakadāgāmi, anāgāmi and arahant respectively (i.e., stream enter on mind, once and non-returner on form, arahant on ārammaṇas). If you try, you must attain it, and have to do it for a reliance. (?? If you try to have to reach it, and you have to do it for a dependency. OR If you try hard, and you must do it for a dependency; you will surely reach it. ??) Breathe strongly if painful. If you take it painful, the mind not want to feel it. (?? Breathe strongly if it is painful. If you treat it as painful, the mind will not want to feel it. ??) With anger or aversion, you’ll go to hell. Don’t stop it. With one sitting, let vedanā cease. Don’t give a perception (saññā) to it, otherwise saṅkhāra will condition it. If vedanā becomes strong, not let these mind states arise; have to breathe strongly (i.e., ānāpāna). [?? If vedanā becomes strong, not allowing these states of mind to arise, you have to breathe strongly (i.e. ānāpāna). ??] Balance samādhi and paññā. 
     	(Here or anywhere of his talks, Sayadaw did not mention how to do it. He only recited a short verse which belonged to Thathom Mingoon Sayadaw. From this verse, later U Candima taught “samādhi like the scales”.)
     	According to the Buddha—the result stopped by killing the cause. Pain, aches, etc are the result dhamma and concept dhammas. Have to know them as vedanā nāma dhamma and this kills the cause. If taking it as pain, aches, etc. is killing the result. (?? If it is treated as pain, aches, etc., it will kill the results. ??) The cause will follow by killing its result. The hotness, aches, etc. will stop by killing the cause. Near death with pain and aches, one will rely on the doctors. Tell people this is exercising for dying (i.e., dealing with pains). You’ll die later. When dying, you’ll know how to die. There are the minds to apāya, to celestial realms and to Nibbāna. You have to know about these minds. You have to practice knowing them with knowledge—wisdom (vijjā-paññā). Furthermore, you can’t overcome it with saññā. If it’s painful, then you’ll be finished, and become afraid. Don’t know like this. When the four great elements are afflicted, vedanās arise. Vedanā is nāma (mind) dhamma. What is the nature of nāma dhamma? It feels and dissolves. How to follow vedanā? Tension is feeling, aching is feeling, etc.
     	
     	P8
     	In this way, know the nature of nāma. The Buddha asked to follow the ending of form and mind natures. Don’t let them be your nature (i.e., by noting as—tense, stiff, hot, cold, etc.). If vedanā becomes strong, breathe strongly. Level samādhi and paññā will see impermanence. 
     	[Here levelling or tuning samādhi and paññā is tuning the five spiritual faculties (indriyas). In Buddhist text or by other teachers not mentioned how to tune it in detail. (?? There is no mention in the scriptures or other teachers of how to tune it in detail. ??) U Candima’s scales like meditation is not an easy one but simple.]
     	 You’ll find out the nature of mind (nāma) which feels sukha and dukkha. The mind fears dukkha and likes (love) sukha. When dukkha vedanā arises, it knows at the legs (in sitting) and not able to bear the pain it moves to the tip of the nostril. Knowing these (dukkha and sukha) to and fro is knowing impermanence (this is not the same as U Candima’s Scales like meditation—see above the instruction of U Candima). If you follow them to the end, mind and form cease at the same time. The mind becomes peaceful and happy. This arrives at cittānupassanā-satipaṭṭhāna, from dukkha into sukha (i.e., into sotāpanna). 
     	Knowing the tip of the nostril is kāyapassanā (i.e., breath meditation), knowing feeling (vedanā) arising is vedanā-satipaṭṭhāna, and then the feeling nature of nāma dhamma will come to ending—and arrive at cittasatipaṭṭhāna (from where one continues to become a once-returner, non-returner and arahant, see Sayadaw’s practice and realization). 
     	Stiffness, tenseness, etc., are not existing dhammas. (?? Stiffness, tension, etc., are non-existent dhammas. ??) Nāma feeling is an existing dhamma. When you arrive cittasatipaṭṭhāna, your destination (good existence—sugati) is stable. You have to practice becoming stable destinations (gati). Work hard! Be patient with vedanā and attack kilesa. If you have patience (i.e., khanti) will attain Nibbāna. What has to be patient? Following the vedanā which arises from the afflicted khandha with patience, from the beginning, middle till to the end. You must work with it, it’ll become vijjā-ñāṇa. If you know or take it as pains and aches will become more painful and aching. Pain and aches are not existing knowledge. 
     	This knowing is everyone knows [?? This understanding is known to everyone OR This is what everyone knows  ??] (even animals).  Feeling of vedanā is the existing knowledge. How to know it to free from the everyone’s knowing? (?? How to know it to be free from everyone's knowledge?  ??) Vedanā is mind (nāma) dhamma. You have to know the mind. If you don’t know the mind and instead knowing as pains and aches is in trouble. (?? If you don't understand the mind, and instead see it as pain and aches, then it is in trouble. ??) Have to go down to apāya, keep this in mind (especially at dying). You only have to know its one nature as feeling and dissolution. And it will become skilled (like in jhāna). If you know vedanā feels and dissolves near death, you will go to sugati heaven (as the Buddha had mentioned). If taking it as pain and aches, you’ll become dogs, pigs, chickens and fishes in the water. You all are eating a lot of pigs, chickens, etc. therefore if you die, you will become ducks, pigs and chicken and repay your debts with the khandhas. Contemplate vedanā to free from me and mine, not let vedanā connect taṇhā. Vedanā is the mind which nature feels and dissolves. Hotness, coldness, stiffness do not exist; without clinging dhamma free from the kammas (actions) of going to the four apāyas. I am correcting your minds (?? thoughts ??). Form (rūpa) nature is afflicted by its own; mind nature is feeling on its own. Where are the pains and aches coming from? Only mind and form exist. You don’t do the habitual practice (bhāvetabba). In the beginning affliction and feeling it, that is knowing with saññā (i.e., right and existing perception). This is asking you to contemplate becoming (?? to become ??) samādhi and paññā. 
     	(At Sayadaw mentioned above—humans have to pay their evil debts with khandhas. This is not an exaggeration. Nowadays humans consume or to be consumed a lot of different kinds of animal flesh where these came from—from animal farms and very few were from forests, rivers and seas. Humans cannot expect to be born in forests.
     	
     	P9
     	Because most of the forests were extinct. Mogok Sayadaw also reminded the yogis to practice hard if not had to pay their debts with khandhas as flesh for foods—as pigs, fowls etc. Or toiled for humans as horses, oxen, etc.)
     	You were watching outdoor shows for the whole night. 
     	(There are many kinds of outdoor shows in Burma. Some relate to religious festivals, some for entertainment. Usually it starts from 7 pm to until dawn. But when for practice, most Buddhists can’t give or use their time or sitting for a short period. Here, Sayadaw referred to practice). 
     	If you sit in meditation and die, you will go to heaven (sit for entertainment will go to apāya). [?? If you sit in meditation, you will go to heaven after death (sitting in recreation will lead to apāya). ??]  If you know only pains and aches, a hundred thousand humans die no-one becomes human again or not born at good destinations (sugati). At dying become unbearable and will go to apāya. [?? Among one hundred thousand people, if one knows only pain and suffering, no one becomes a human being again after death or is not born in a good destination (sugati). It becomes unbearable at the time of death and will enter apāya. ??] During going and coming (i.e., in daily life), you have to know feeling (experiencing) vedanā and its dissolution (i.e., the same as Soon Loon Sayadaw’s way of practice). Sitting meditation is changing apāya destinations with heavenly realms. Pains and aches are upadham-dhamma (??upadhānaṃ-dhamma ??) which are unbearable minds. These are lobha, dosa, moha minds. Knowing of feeling and dissolution is right view (sammā-diṭṭhi). Knowing of pains and aches is wrong view (micchā-diṭṭhi). All these are wholesome minds and unwholesome minds. Only these two mind states exist. (Kusala cittas and akusala citta), sugati minds and apāya minds. You have to practice for a fixed destination (gati) and become skilled. 
     	(Regarding shows and entertainments, I heard a story from a Burmese. There was a well known traditional Burmese dancer. He worked for his professional career until old age. One of his sons was a famous movie actor. When the dancer died, a village woman had a dream. The dream was the dancer after death taking rebirth at her place in the womb of a she-pig. This news spread widely and became well known. Later the dancer’s son bought this piglet and looked after it very well. There is a sutta in Saṃyutta Nikāya in parallel with this case. It is called Tālapuṭa Discourse, Salayatanavagga. (SN.42.2) Actor Tālapuṭa asked the Buddha where an actor would take rebirth after death. The Buddha’s answer was—hell or animals. The audiences are also not good either. Nowadays movies, video games, etc. are more and more sexual (?? erotic ??) and violence. So their minds are more and more polluted with lust, anger and delusion.)
     	Thae-inn Gu Sayadaw’s teaching is how much success for yogis I don’t have any idea. (?? I have no idea how successful Thae-inn Gu Sayadaw's teaching has been for yogis. ??) Sayadaw U Candima’s teaching seems quite successful. From their autobiographies and practices, we can say that they had pāramīs. The most important point is the quality of their minds. Both of them are tough, resolute, have a lot of patience and endurance with strong faiths and true noble warriors. Pāramī is coming from practice. So a Buddhist’s duty is to study and practice Dhamma.
     	A noble search does only exist in the Buddha Dhamma. So it is a very difficult and rare chance to encounter. Therefore, the Buddha Dhamma represents wholesome and noble education. Other worldly knowledge and religions what they can teach human beings only wholesome education. (?? Other secular knowledge and religions have only wholesome education that they can teach to human beings. ??) This much is even very rare. Only the sages and the wise can do it. Most human beings only end up with ignoble educations and searches. Nowadays, human situations are more and more inclined towards this direction. From societies to internationals, many problems, dangers and disasters arise from this kind of education and search. Humans are more and more greedy and selfish. It seems to me, only two types of people make this beautiful earth become an unpleasant place—immoral politicians (some world leaders) and very greedy wealthy people—i.e., misuse of power and wealth. The most stupid and foolish thing is arms industries and businesses. If you don’t use it for killing and murdering people, what is the use of it. U.S.A. is a good example. If arms industries and arms businesses develop and flourish, there will be no peace and human well-being in the world. These power mongers and wealth mongers always look for excuses to create wars and instability around the world. 
     	In the Dhammapada—XXIV: Craving (Taṇhā)
     	Verse 355:       
     	  Riches (powers) ruin the man
     	  Weak in discernment,
     	  but not those who seek
     	         the beyond. (noble search)
     	  Through craving for riches (powers)
     	  the man weak in discernment
     	                  ruins himself
     	  as he would others
     	(Present day all kinds of pollution and violence happen or happen around the world testify the wisdom and discernment of the Buddha.) (?? All kinds of pollution and violence occurring in the world today testify to the Buddha's wisdom and insight. ??)
     	There was a wise message or remark made by Ven. Nyanatiloka Mahāthera (a pioneer German monk) in his address in 1956 at the Sixth Buddhist Council. “For the Buddha’s doctrine forms the only safe and firm road that will keep mankind away from those crude materialistic notions which are the root-causes of all selfishness, greed, hate and therefore of war and cruelty, and of all misery in the world.”
     	I will end this noble search with the following story on taṇhā—craving and clinging. In Sayadaw U Candima’s talk on Living, Dying and Future, he told a story of a woman. She was rich and kept a lot of gold in a safe. Sometimes she was thinking of making merits with it, but because of stinginess and cannot let it go. Unexpectedly one day she died and left everything behind. After she died, the children wanted to divide the wealth among them. What did they find out when they opened the safe? They found out a big myaw (Burmese) clung to the golds. (I don’t know it in English. It’s similar between a leech and a slug without eyes and mouth with a grey color body, emits liquid like mucus.) U Candima said that this animal was spontaneous birth (opapātika). In Buddhist texts, spontaneous births are related to (?? only associated with ??) some petas, heavenly beings and hell beings only, and never mentioned animals. There is a parallel story in the Dhammapada—Impurities (Mala vagga, Dhp. 240), the story of monk Tissa who died with attachment to his new robes and was born as a louse in the robe. This is a very quick rebirth that can be counted as spontaneous. 
     	A western teacher said, “People who don’t realize the harm they can do to themselves and to other people are really dangerous.” That is true, and it can be related to all worldlings who are full of kilesas. With strong desire and anger, one can do all possible evil things to oneself and others without knowing the consequences. The education on the law of kamma becomes very important to every human being whatever their color of skin, nationality, culture and religions. Because it is a universal teaching. Everyone understands kamma rightly and seriously about it, they will have shame and fear of wrong doings. These two qualities are the guardian dhammas of the world. Even if we can’t follow the Buddha Dhamma to become a noble being or at least become a decent human being. (?? Even if we cannot follow the Buddha's Dhamma and become a noble person, we should at least become a decent person. ??)  It’s not only to create peace, harmony and well-being in this life but also the future life to come.
