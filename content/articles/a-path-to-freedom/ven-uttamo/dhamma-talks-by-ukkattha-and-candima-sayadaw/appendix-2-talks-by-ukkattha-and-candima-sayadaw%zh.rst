Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is the right samādhi in the Noble Eightfold Path? There are two answers to this important question. The first is from the Buddha himself, the others are from commentaries, including scholars and practicing Buddhists. The Buddha's right samādhi is the four rūpa-jhānas. The right samādhi of commentaries are khaṇika samādhi, upacāra samādhi with the four rūpa jhānas. The scholars and practising monks’ (including teachers and students) right samādhi are with their interpretations, views and together with the suttas and commentaries.

Doubts and confusion come from the interpretations and views of some scholars and practising monks (including lay teachers with students). One of the dangers of the decline of paṭipatti (practice) is that if one claims to be a teacher without enlightenment; and any of the “Paths and Fruits” and their teachings are only for the sake of fame and fortune, and become like a business. Sayadaw U Candima mentioned these things in some of his teachings. This is evident if we observe the famous Thai forest tradition, especially that of Ajahn Mun, where no one among his disciples ever opened a meditation center for money or fame. These money and competition syndromes facing humanity today can bring destruction and suffering to both humans and nature.

The Buddha did not mention khaṇika samādhi and upacāra samādhi in the suttas. This is the commentaries view and does not mean that it could be wrong. It can come from the experience of some yogis in the past. We can see these in the teachings of some Thai forest monks. Some scholars can misinterpret some of the commentary teaching (some are self-styled scholars). In his book "The way to Stream Entry", Sayadaw U Candima mentioned the following regarding the misunderstanding of scholars regarding the mention of khaṇika samādhi in the commentaries.

The attainment of khaṇika samādhi was mentioned in Mahānidessa aṭṭhakathā, Paṭisambhidāmagga aṭṭhakathā and Dhammasaṅgaṇi aṭṭhakathā. When completed with rapture (pīti, one of the five elements of the first jhāna), it will also become the completion of the tranquility of body and mind (kāya and citta passaddhi). And with the two tranquilities, it’ll become bodily and mental happiness (kāyika and cetasika sukha). Then, completing with these two happinesses, it’ll become khaṇika, upacāra and appanā samādhi respectively."

Therefore, the kind of khaṇika samādhi means according to the aṭṭhakathā and ṭīkā, it has completed with rapture, tranquility and happiness. It means the kind of samādhi which has the five jhanic factors. There can be a wide range of them from upacāra to rūpa and arūpa jhānas. So khaṇika samādhi has many levels. We should not look down on daily mindfulness or awareness (sati) in our lives as insignificance. If we look at the noble eightfold path of the samādhi factors, it includes sati, viriya and samādhi which are together. Without the establishment of mindfulness we can’t protect ourselves and others (see the Sedaka Sutta, Saṃyutta Nikāya). Sati practice is purifying the mind-it leads to sīla, samādhi and paññā (this is the practice of Mahasi System). Restraining our sense faculties needs sati. We can only solve all human problems with suffering with the Buddha Dhamma—a noble education. Without it, we, all of us, become CRAZY HUMAN BEINGS, greedy and selfish.

We depend on this kind of khaṇika samādhi to develop insight (with five jhanic factors).

To become insight right view (vipassanā sammā-diṭṭhi), we must have the purification of mind (citta-visuddhi) or upekkhā ekaggatā samādhi (one-pointed samādhi with equanimity). The dry insight (suddha-vipassanā) as only vipassanā practice without samatha (i.e. jhāna practice) is true, but the yogi must have one-pointed samādhi with equanimity. Most of us forget or miss this important point (this refers to vipassanā practices before him). Before the mind becomes citta-visuddhi or sammā-samādhi or upekkhā ekaggatā samādhi the mind cannot incline toward the objects of paramatā mind and form, which are the objects (arom, ārammaṇa) of strong insight (balavantu-vipassanā). Dry insight does not have the jhanic factors. 

For the purification of mind, you have to contemplate or observe the cessation of the object sign (nimitta—here is insight objects or the four satipaṭṭhāna objects) by suppressing greed and distress (abhijjhā and domanassa) and attain upekkhā ekaggatā samādhi. Here suppression is temporary suppression (vikkhambhana) which is the same as by the samatha jhanic factors. The samatha signs and vipassanā signs are different types. Samatha stabilizes the object signs and vipassanā observes the nature of the signs, which have the three universal characteristics. Therefore, samatha practice without vipassanā develops concepts and self views (see the Baka Brahma, MN 49 Brahmanimantanika Sutta).

Samatha yānika is the development of wisdom by samadhi, while vipassanā yānika is the development of samadhi by wisdom. These are mentioned in the Yuganaddha Sutta—In Conjunction (Aṅguttara Nikāya). Samatha yānika way is relying on the samādhi signs and developing the five jhanic factors of pīti, sukha, etc. that the practice is more comfortable than vipassanā yānika way. It takes more time to develop jhānas. Vipassanā yānika is without the samatha signs that it is dry and tough. But it can realize paths and fruits quicker than samatha yānika way. (e.g., Soon Loon Sayadaw, The-inn Gu Sayadaw, etc.). Some vipassanā yānikas are based on some samatha practices but not to jhanic states (e.g., upacāra samādhi in U Ba Khin's teaching).

Therefore, vipassanā yānika way is called suddha vipassanā practice or animitta cetto samādhi practice. I think we can find the Pāli usage in the suttas. Even though we differentiate between samatha and vipassanā yānika ways, the main point is attaining of upekkhā ekaggatā samādhi or samādhi-indriya.

There are also other Pāli words for samādhi—such as vipassanā jhāna or lakkhaṇa-rūpa jhāna, supramundane jhāna by scholars. This has confused people, if possible, to use only the Pali words mentioned in the suttas.

The problem of what is right samādhi makes Buddhist practicers confusion, and there are a lot of arguments going on in the West with different views and opinions. There are some western Buddhists reject the validity of khaṇika samādhi on the ground that it was not mentioned in the suttas. They don't trust the commentaries and even some go to extreme, rejecting the whole Abhidhamma Piṭaka. Some years ago, three Sri Lanka monks, Ven. Soma, Ven. Kheminda and Ven. Kassapa; and the German lama Anagarika Govinda criticized khaṇika samādhi in the Mahasi System. Some of Mahasi Sayadaw's senior disciples replied for them. It can be found on the internet.

There was an interesting experiment done by the late Prime Minister U Nu of Burma with a Mahasi monk on the fruition state (phala sammāpaṭipatti). This research was described in his booklet on the Tipiṭakas. U Nu invited a Mahasi monk to his place and requested him for entering into fruition state. U Nu did not mention his name and he was not from Rangoon, because after the research he was flown back to his monastery by plane. It seems to me this research was arranged by Mahasi Sayadaw himself. This monk was in the fruition state for six days and six nights. Therefore, U Nu arranged for some people to observe him by replacing the observers.

An American meditation teacher interviewed Pha-auk Sayadaw about the disagreements of western Buddhists regarding what is jhāna and right samādhi. Sayadaw said that people did not understand the Pāli Texts well. He also said that jhāna practices were explained clearly in the Visuddhimagga. He advised him they should trace it back to the original suttas, the original commentaries and sub-commentaries (i.e., old commentaries). After that, for Visuddhimagga, they will understand the meaning. This important point is also mentioned by Dr. Nandamalarbhivamsa Sayadaw and his many Dhamma talks enriched my knowledge and profundity of the Dhamma. He made this remark as how many of them really studied the commentaries and made the bold criticism. (He says this because of how many of them have actually studied the commentaries and made bold criticisms.)

Even I heard a story that a well-known western monk who had never studied Abhidhamma Piṭaka declared it as not authentic (including the commentaries) and he rejected all of them, and also encouraged others the same way. He also admitted that he had never studied the issue before and had only gained second-hand knowledge from others.

There are many Buddhists whose understanding of the Dhamma is like the monkey's understanding of Dukkha in this story below. An old Brahmin became nervous every day because his old wife was talkative and aggressive. She scolded him every day and found faults. As a result, he went to a large tree nearby every day to moan and release his stress. “Oh! It's dukkha. It's dukkha.” A monkey stayed in this tree and often heard the word Dukkha and became curious about it. So he came down from the tree and asked the Brahman, “What is this dukkha you keep mentioning?” The Brahmin was already in distress and wanted to teach the monkey a lesson. So he replied to him, “You must wait for me here tomorrow, and I'll bring dukkha for you.” Next day, the Brahmin put a ferocious dog in a gunny bag and closed the opening with a rope. And then he took it under the tree and called out to the monkey to come down and look for himself what dukkha was. The brahman stayed away from a distance and observed the monkey. The monkey came down from the tree and opened the gunny bag slowly. As soon as it was opened, the distressed dog came out angrily with growls and tried to bite the monkey.

The monkey jumped up the tree instantly with a fright and sat on a branch looking down at the dog which was still barking at him. The monkey made this exclamation; "Oh! My God, I know! I know! Dukkha means aggressive eyes with frightening sharp teeth." Some Western philosophies of Dukkha are not so different from this monkey (see hedonism, imperialism, capitalism, competition syndrome, money syndrome, etc.). They don't see the dangers and even fall in love with Dukkha!

Khaṇika samādhi has many levels on the way when it reaches the level of upekkhā ekaggatā samādhi. It was like the still flowing water. Ajan Cha gave the still flowing water simile or analogy to this samādhi as follows.

------

STILL, Flowing Water
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Have you ever seen flowing water? Have you ever seen still water? If your mind is peaceful, it's like still, flowing water. Have you ever seen still, flowing water? There! You've only seen flowing water and still water (i.e., separately). You have never seen still, flowing water (i.e., together). Right there, right where your thinking can't take you: where the mind is still but can develop discernment. When you look at your mind, it'll be like flowing water, and yet still. It looks like it's still, it looks like it's flowing, so it's called still, flowing water. That's what it's like. That's where discernment can arise.”

In training yogis to develop samadhi, U Candima teaches the three stages of samadhi, or what he calls the three bhavaṅgas. The first "bhavaṅga samadhi" has the power of the first jhāna, the 2nd "bhavaṅga" corresponds to the 2nd plus the 3rd jhāna, and the 3rd "bhavaṅga" corresponds to the fourth jhāna. 

These three bhavaṅgas have their own qualities and functions. Only arriving at the level of the 3rd bhavaṅga, one can discern the viññāṇa, with this samādhi power, he can develop great insight (mahā-vipassanā).

There are three important suttas in his teaching—those are: Āsīvisopama Sutta—the Simile of the Vipers (SN 35. 238, Saḷāyatanavagga, Saṃyutta Nikāya), Vammika Sutta—the Ant-hill (Sutta no. 23, Majjhima Nikāya), Chachakka Sutta—the Six Sets of Six (Sutta no. 148, Majjhima Nikāya). Of the three sutras, the two, āsīvisopama Sutta and Chachakka Sutta, are more relevant to his instruction in practice.

I have a purpose for writing this long article. The most recent books (“Two Sides of a Coin” and “A Noble Search”) are life stories told by The-inn Gu Sayadaw and Sayadaw U Candima themselves to inspire readers. There I have translated only some of his talks (i.e. U Candima's Dhamma) on the practice of samadhi and some controversies with Buddhists about the nature of right samadhi and true insight. I relied on some of his instructional talks in his nine days retreat for yogis. These recorded talks were not complete and mixed up with some of his Dhamma talks to lay people. I don't even have a clear understanding of them myself (all of them are compiler errors). Now, I base this essay on his book—“The Way to Stream Entry”.

The reader should use this article to read the autobiographical and Dhamma talk of U Candima, which has the practice of samādhi. I have included only important excerpts from his book so that readers can get a general idea of his life and teaching. I hope that the life and teaching of U Candima will address some of the issues of samādhi and insight faced by the practitioner.

Samādhi Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before we study U Candima's teaching on samādhi practice we have to understand the Āsīvisopama Sutta- the simile of the Vipers Discourse. His samādhi teaching is related to the discourse. The similes in this discourse are: a criminal (a monk or yogi); the four vipers (the four great elements); the five executioners (the five clinging khandhas); the intimate companion or murderer (delight-lust,  nandirāga); the six village-attacking dacoits (the six external objects), etc.

In the following, we will compare the way of vipassanā yānika and samatha yānika.

------

:: 

                                 Vipassanā Yānika
                           ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
                           Sīla, samādhi, paññā together


	the 4 viper chase	   the criminal runs	  (safety place)			
   ––––––––––––––––––– → ––––––––––––––––– →	–––––––––––––––––––– →	
	the 4 elements 		   the yogi practise	the 1st bhavaṅga
	(affliction with dosa)				the 1st jhāna of samatha


	 followed by 5 executioners	 	(safety place)				
   →––––––––––––––––––––––––––– →	––––––––––––––––––––––––– →
	  the 5 clinging khandhas	 the 2nd bhavaṅga
					 (the 2nd and 3rd jhānas)


	  the intimate murderer	 (safety place)		  the 6 dacoits
   →––––––––––––––––––––– →	–––––––––––––––– →  ––––––––––––––––––→
	delight-lust		 the 3rd bhavaṅga	the 6 external objects	
	 						  (the 4th jhāna)


	  continue to run to the other shore
   → ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––---
	  mahā-vipassanā with Chachakka Sutta	
	           attain nibbāna

Here samatha yānika separates from paññā and develops sīla and samādhi with a samatha object and attains the four jhānas. His 1st jhāna is equal to the 1st bhavaṅga, the 2nd and 3rd jhānas to the 2nd bhavaṅga and the 4th jhāna to the 3rd bhavaṅga. After the samatha jhānas continues with the insight practice.

In vipassanā yānika practice, at the level of purification of the mind, the main point here is to abandon greed, hatred and delusion of the defilement in stages to attain samādhi faculty (samādhi-indriya). Therefore, purification of mind (citta visuddhi) has three stages. The first stage or the first bhavaṅga is abandoned the faculty of pain (dukkhindriya) for temporary period (tadaṅga), suppression (vikkhambhana) and eradication (samuccheda pahānas) respectively. At the 2nd and third levels of the purification of the mind practice, using the ways of animitta cetto samādhi to purify the mind.

Note: One important point the yogi has to remember is: With any one of the four satipaṭṭhāna objects (i.e., kāya, vedanā, citta and dhamma objects), he must discern the characteristic (lakkhaṇa) path factor mind (magga citta) and the four noble truths. at the same time with every contemplation (according to the Mogok Sayadawgyi's dhamma talks: i.e., anicca / magga + the four noble truths, see Mogok Dhamma Talks in three volumes). These three points are temporary mundane path factors (tadaṅga lokiya magga). Without these three points or factors, the practice is not completed.

In vipassanā yānika practice of cittavisuddhi, there are three stages or levels in accordance with the maturity of sīla and samādhi. They are as follows:

1. The first level of purification of the mind
This practice eradicates dosa and taṇhā (samuccheda pahāna) come from bodily painful feeling (kāyika dukkha vedanā).

With this samādhi (the first bhavaṅga) can contemplate the following phenomena (dhammas). These are:

| (1) The 32 bodily parts; the four great elements (kāyanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna)
| (2) The changes of the paramatā rūpa (form) (kāyanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna)
| (3) The feeling of the paramatā mind (vedananupassanā satipaṭṭhāna)
| (4) The inclination of mind contact (mano-samphassa / paramatā mind (cittanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna)
| (5) Contemplate the three characteristics of paramatā mind and form (dhammānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna)
| 

2. the 2nd level of purification of the mind

This practice can stop the five hindrances (nīvaraṇas) from the mind for two hours. With this samādhi (the 2nd bhavaṅga) can contemplate the following phenomena. These are:

| (1) small particles (kalāpas) of form/ matter (paramatā form) (kāyanupassanā)
| (2) the feeling of the paramatā mind (vedananupassanā)
| (3) the inclination of mind Contact (mano-samphassa /paramatā mind) (cittanupassanā)
| (4) contemplate the three characteristics of paramatā mind and form (dhammānupassanā)
| 

3. the 3rd level of purification of the mind

This practice can stop the five hindrances from the mind as long as one's wish. With this samādhi (the 3rd bhavaṅga) can contemplate the following phenomena. These are:

(1) the clear six bases (the internal āyatanas—such as eye, ear, nose...) and the six sense objects (the external āyatanas) of the paramatā form (dhammānupassanā)

(2) the feeling of the paramatā mind (vedananupassanā)

(3) the six contacts (phassas); the five consciousness (eye consciousness, ear to body consciousness-the five viññāṇas); mind consciousness (mano viññāṇa); the preceding mind consciousness without roots (ahetuka mano viññāṇa); the following mind consciousness with roots (sahetu mano viññāṇa—Such as greed, hatred, delusions and non-greed, non-hatred, non-delusion = the three unwholesome roots and three wholesome roots) (cittanupassanā)

(4) contemplate the three characteristics of the above-mentioned— i.e., the above one, two and three phenomena of paramatā mind and form (dhammānupassanā)

Note: Here we found two important dhamma mentioned by U Candima— these are: paramatā mind and form or the five khandhas and the ahetuka and hetuka mano viññāṇas. Without the purification of mind in three levels, yogi can’t discern the paramatā mind and form. Even the first and second levels of bhavaṅga can't discern some of them mentioned at the 3rd level of bhavaṅga.

To understand the ahetuka and sahetu mano viññāṇa, the reader should have some knowledge in Abhidhamma. This is the 14 actions of process consciousness.

We can roughly define it as passive and active consciousnesses. These two consciousnesses support the authentic teaching of the Abhidhamma which came from direct experiences of practice.
The above lists of three levels of samādhi and their meditation objects are the nature of the practices and not arranged by U Candima. It was like the following example.

To attain the coconut milk from a coconut fruit, we have to deal with the three layers of its fruit. These are the outer soft skin, the middle hard skin and the inner coconut meat. In the same way, the active consciousness (sahetu, or hetuka) is covered up with the 10 kilesas or the 14 unwholesome mental states (see the Abhidhamma).

These defilement have to be abandoned in three stages: the coarse ones or active state (vītikkama) are abandoned first; the mild ones or the calm state (pariyuṭṭhāna) as the 2nd, and the refined ones or the latent state (anusaya) as the 3rd respectively.

The first stage of purification of the mind (Cittavisuddhi)
[The practice cutting off samuccheda dosa and taṇhā from bodily painful feeling.]

There are six meditations (kammaṭṭhānas) in this stage as follows.

| 1. the basic ānāpāna kammaṭṭhāna
| 2. the basic vipassanā kammaṭṭhāna of the 32 parts of the body
| 3. the basic vipassanā kammaṭṭhāna of the great four elements
| 4. Bhavaṅga meditation (nāma-kammaṭṭhāna)
| 5. Half-lotus meditation (nāma-kammaṭṭhāna)
| 
| 6. Mahā-pallinka (Mahāpallaṅka) meditation or full-lotus meditation or Diamond meditation (i.e., my translation) (this is nāma-kammaṭṭhāna)
| 

Note: No. 5 and no. 6—half and full lotus meditations are similar to bhavaṅga meditation, but I don't know why U Candima called them half and full lotus meditations. These are the postures that represent the yogi. In Mahāyana tradition—especially Chinese Zen and Japanese Zen Buddhism—these postures are used as the standard for sitting.

U Candima's instruction: Meditations no. 1, no. 4, no. 5 and no. 6 have to be practised serially. No. 4 bhavaṅga meditation, all yogis must practise it. The sixth mahāpallaṅka meditation can only be practiced by yogis who are able to sit cross-legged (full-lotus).

Meditations—no. 2 and no. 3 are also basic meditations, like no. 1 here. For vipassanā yānika yogi he can choose no. 2 or no. 3, any one of them, instead of no. 1 as a basic kammaṭṭhāna. Basic meditation’s no. 1, no. 2 and no. 3 become one at the attainment of vipassanā knowledge level.

Note: In this essay, I will not mention meditations—no. 1, no. 4, no.5 and no. 6 again.

The reader can go back to my book on U Candima's life in “A Noble Search”. If you want a little more detail, you should check out his ebook "The Way to Stream Entry" on Amazon. I will only mention meditations: no. 2 and no. 3 here. Before I talk about these two meditations, I would like to mention that some yogis experience the following phenomena in the basic ānāpāna practice, which depend on the yogi's paramī (pāramitā). These are:

(1) mental signs of loathsomeness (asubha nimitta) and the mental signs of 32 parts of the body will arise (e.g., bone).

| (2) arriving at upacāra samādhi of the first jhāna
| (3) the mental sign of the air column appears.
| (4) the mental sign of a Buddha (Buddha nimitta and other mental signs will appear.
| 

(1) Asubha nimitta and 32 bodily parts of bone, etc

During the ānāpāna breathing one’s own body seems to become swollen, and it expands more and more. One's body in sitting or someone's body appears as asubha form deformed or putrid. Breathing is going on by itself with no fear. At the time, the mind is controlled by samādhi. Exercising this asubha nimitta until it becomes stable.

Some yogis with wrong attention (ayoniso) take them as unpleasant, fearful, etc. Humans don’t see the reality of asubha (foulness, loathsomeness) instead they only see the pleasantness, beauty (subha) that taṇhā, māna and diṭṭhi arise. Not seeing the asubha, we have encountered dukkha in the long existences of saṃsāra. By seeing the asubha signs, we do not cling to our own body or to other bodies.

Some yogis only see the bone nimitta and they must exercise to stabilize the sign. The perception of subha is leased by seeing the bones. The concepts of combination and names (samūha and nāma paññatti) are ceased. From asubha and bone nimittas, the nature of the four great elements can be easily discerned.

Bone and asubha nimittas are the objects of samatha (ārammaṇa). It calms down kilesas. Based on these objects (ārammaṇa) yogis contemplate its nature for the cessation of taṇhā, māna and diṭṭhi. From the foulness of the body (asubha),  putrid blood and liquid are the characteristics of water element (āpa). The body looks black and dry, like a burnt object, which is the characteristic of the fire element (teja). The swollen nature is the characteristic of air element (vāya). The nature of stiffness is the characteristic of earth element (paṭhavī). So these asubha objects change into four elements and contemplate with the three universal characteristics as kāyanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna practice (mindfulness of the body).

The contemplative mind sees the four elements on the basis of asubha kammaṭṭhāna and skeleton kammaṭṭhāna , free from the obsession with the wrong view of human, man and woman. According to the Āsīvisopama sutta, this is free from the four vipers. Yogis who can contemplate the signs of asubha and 32 bodily parts have to continue with no. (4, 5, 6) meditations respectively (see the list of the first level of cittavisuddhi). This way of practice is The-inn Gu Sayadaw's method.

(2) Arriving at upacāra samādhi of the first jhāna
With ānāpānasati when the mind arrives at the level of upacāra samādhi the yogi will find out that the breathing is going on by itself without effort.

At the time, the mind frees from the oppression of the four elements, and it stays with the breath at the touching point happily. This is upacāra first jhāna. U Candima used the word jhāna instead of samādhi. The mind is protected by the one pointedness of samādhi (ekaggatā samādhi) that dosa, domanassa and taṇhā fire which arisen from the four disturbed elements (i.e., the four vipers) are ceased. Upacāra samādhi has the five jhanic factors. The yogi has to exercise the upacāra jhāna samādhi to become skilled. He can also continue to develop other jhāna levels by studying the texts of samatha yānika way.

(3) The mental sign of breath column appears

Before the mind becomes ekaggatā samādhi the sign of the breath column appears at the touching point of the nostril. It was like a white string of smoke, the sign of an air column going in and out at the entrance of the nostril. The mind is inclined toward the nimitta and staying there, and doesn't want to leave the place. The mind is completed with the five jhanic factors of ekaggatā samādhi.

The yogi, who wants to continue with ānāpānasati, has to rely on this sign, tries to stabilize it by five ways of mastery. (i.e., reflect on the jhanic factors; could enter this samādhi at any time; come out at any time; determine the time span; mastery in reviewing.)

When it becomes stable, there is no dukkha vedanā caused by the disturbed four great elements. After being freed from mental hindrances (nīvaraṇas), the yogi continues to practice, making samādhi stronger by exercising samādhi without time restrictions (i.e., sitting in samādhi as long as possible, as he did). When ekaggatā samadhi is stabilized on this nimitta (which may be at the stage of the first jhāna), one can come out of this samādhi to contemplate insight (Vipassanā) on the jhanic factors. If wanting to develop up to fourth jhanic Samādhi continue with the samatha yānika practice.

Note: Here U Candima makes an important point on upacāra samādhi. That is stabilizing the nimitta of upacāra samādhi which has never been mentioned by anyone before. It was only at the stage of 1st jhāna. Some systems use upacāra samādhi to develop insight (e.g., U Ba Khin's teaching). A teacher said that upacāra samādhi is not very stable. When someone is very close to the first jhāna in the upacāra samādhi stage, it is unwise not to go further into the jhanic state.

(4) Buddha nimitta and others

In ānāpāna practice when the breathing has good acceleration with samādhi the mind becomes clear, cool and happy. Based on this mental state and clinging (upādāna) the mental signs of Buddha image, ceti, cloud, deities, grassland, mountain, etc. appear. If the yogi wants to develop the Buddha nimitta he can continue it. The others are worldly sensual objects (lokiya kāma ārammaṇa) and it has to be abandoned and return to the ānāpāna object.

The yogi wants to continue with the Buddha nimitta, he has to exercise to become stable. When it becomes stable, the mind has intense reverence with rapture (pīti). Based on this pīti, it develops to sukha-ekaggatā samādhi (one-pointedness of mind with happiness). If the yogi wants to base on jhāna practice he can continue with the samatha yānika way (i.e., develop jhānas) 

For vipassanā yānika yogi, he contemplates on the Buddha nimitta as form is unstable and has the nature of change. Contemplate on the nimitta as perishing, and then it changes into the object of dissolution. When the dissolution of the Buddha sign becomes more intense, give it up; concentrate on your own body, and you will see the body form dissolving. Based on this perishing form, continue the contemplation with the three universal characteristics (i.e., anicca, dukkha and anatta). After that, practice with the four element meditation (as mentioned at the first purification, no. 3). This yogi still needs to do all the others’ no. 4, no. 5 and no. 6 meditation [see “The first stage of purification of the mind (Cittavisuddhi)” above] for the first level of purification.

2. Basic vipassanā kammaṭṭhāna of the 32 body parts

This practice can be done without using other kinds of samādhi to develop it (e.g., ānāpāna samādhi). Yogi can use the 32 parts directly by itself. It can be practised in any postures (the four postures). The object of meditation that appears in the mind depends on the intensity of the yogi's saddha, chanda and viriya (faith, desire and effort).

“Not seeing rightly taṇhā enters; knowing wrongly caught up with diṭṭhi; taking not human as human being, saṃsāra becomes long with kilesa heat and complications.”

Not seeing the real correctly and clinging to the unreal gives rise to the defilement (kilesa) of diṭṭhi, taṇhā, and kamma. Wanting to extinguish these unwholesome dhammas have to discern rightly on the reality. The wrong dhammas (adhamma) of clinging to man, woman, father, mother, son, daughter, etc. fall away by knowing rightly. This is not the outcome of creation. Contemplate many times on the reality such as hair, nail, teeth, skin, etc. which are the group of matter (rūpa) by knowing rightly clinging to the unreal and wrong clinging will fall away. The group of 32 body parts are not man and woman, not soul and self. It's only the existence of real form groups. Yogis have to see them many times with knowledge (ñāṇa). This is the right view. 

The Way of Practice

At the instruction of basic ānāpāna practice with the ānāpāna samādhi and the mahāpallaṅka samādhi (no. 6 practice),  the yogis could contemplate any one of the 32 parts of the body (e.g., bone) or all of them. If the yogis don't want to base on these samādhis he takes one of the parts or all of them, e.g., the bone. The yogi views it with the mind eye and contemplates as “bone, bone”, etc. The reason for contemplating with the mind is that there is no basic samādhi (as in ānāpāna samādhi). Therefore, do not leave the mind in a state of distraction and develop it with perception.

If the mind is distracted, send the mind back to the object and continue the practice. After discerning one of the parts, continue with other parts. With a lot of contemplation, the perceptions of men, women, hands, feet, body, head, etc.  cease and the bone, the skin, the flesh, etc.,  become clear in the mind eye.

When it becomes clear, there is no need to use mental perceptions such as “bone, bone”. Instead, using one's knowledge (ñāṇa) on the 32 body parts, contemplate many times as follows. These bones, skin, flesh, etc. are not the outcome of my creation. It is not me and not mine; not man and woman or person and living being; and not a soul; not created by father and mother. All these phenomena are arisen from the past of the result—avijjā, taṇhā, upādāna, kamma-bhava (avijjā...,  kamma-bhava = causes and the five khandhas = result). These are the original nature of the group of matter (rūpa) as these 32 body parts are only rūpa dhamma (phenomena). Yogis have to contemplate and analyze it with wisdom many times.

To contemplate with samādhi and paññā, the yogi knows and sees the composite nature of the form group in the state of dissolution. The external objects of living beings and life-less objects (a tree, its leaves and fruits, etc.) are also in dissolution by looking at them.

Note: Some might think 32 body parts are only the objects of samatha and not the objects of insight (vipassanā). This view is held by most Burmese Buddhists (one of the reasons may be influenced by the Abhidhamma teaching). Thai forest monks don't see it that way. They use the 32 parts in both ways of practice (samatha and vipassanā). Insight knowledge (vipassanā ñāṇa) means contemplation of the intrinsic nature of phenomenon, which have no images or signs.

Therefore, some yogis take the 32 parts as having shapes and signs and not the vipassanā objects. So even nimittas arise, they destroy the themes of meditation (kammaṭṭhāna).

Intrinsic nature of phenomena are the province of knowledge (ñāṇa). The objects of ñāṇa are only existing as mind and form (nāma-rūpa). The worldlings are clinging to form (rūpa) with the concepts of ignorance, such as body, hand, feet, man, woman, dogs, chicken, etc. These clinging concepts are replaced with the 32 parts of concept. Being able to contemplate with bone concepts, the concepts of man and woman, etc. cease. If the yogi still knows it as bone, then it is the object of samatha.

It becomes insight by contemplating the intrinsic nature of skeleton (bones). The wrong view of man, woman, etc. falls away by discerning its intrinsic nature. Kāma, rāga, dosa are abandoned for some time (tadaṅga). If knowing the objects by itself with no contemplation of its intrinsic nature—then seeing form or mind also as samatha (not leads to insight). Because mind and form (nāma-rūpa) objects calm the mind from kilesa. Those who practice Dhamma should be aware of this.

Basic meditation on the four great elements

The practice is direct contemplation of the element without having any basic samādhi first (the same as 32 body parts). Contemplate on the four element is kāyanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna. Contemplate the mind experiencing of the undesirable and desirable (aniṭṭha and iṭṭha) feelings when the elements are disturbed, afflicted, changed, it is vedananupassanā satipaṭṭhāna.

First, take the object of natural breathing. With sati, observe the breath coming in and going out by itself with natural causes. When the air is pushing in and out, there is a gap. It happens alternately. Investigate the process carefully? The original nature of this body is to bring in and take out the air element. Is it your body? (form, rūpa). Does this meet your desires? Is it a condition for you or this is not your condition? It operates by its own nature. You have to distinguish them.  During the sleep, it also breathes in this way. Do you have to play a role for it? Or is it its own nature at play? Investigate and contemplate it. During the sleep you are not breathing for it, and you'll know its nature without any doubt. So it's not your function; because in sleep you don't know anything. Therefore, this is not your breathing in and out. This is not me and no-one instigates it. Contemplate as there is no person and being. This khandha house is conditioning itself by the power of kammic energy. 

The yogis have to investigate and contemplate many times with knowledge (ñāṇa) until it becomes firmly.

In this way, while eating the meal, at bath, walking and talking, at any time and any place, the breathing is functioning without my own account. If these happen within my power, it can be controlled without aging, without pain and without death. Now, this body is alive and not my own creation. It does its own job and is according to its nature, not my body. You have to contemplate and investigate it, and also be mindful and aware all the time to the nature of the breathing (these are the factors for awakening—mindfulness and investigation).

In this way, investigate and contemplate the air element and become aware of other nature in the element. When the air comes in it is cool, when it goes out it is warm. This is characteristic of the heat element (teja). Pressure and distention is an air element (vāya). From outside, the air and heat elements support the nutriment (āhāra) to the body from outside. The body needs air, so it fills with air, it needs heat (cool and warm), so it fills and heat. 

Contemplate and investigate this nature with knowledge. The yogi does not know where the air begins to enter and where it begins to exit. It doesn't have any stability and it’s changing all the time. All these processes mean the conditioning nature of form (rūpa) is a reality. There is no person, being and soul to condition it. With contemplation, one can use knowledge to discern. Try to stop the nature of the air element of form (rūpa) to come in and go out with one’s atta (the self). It can't be stopped, and one's atta will be in failure. Form saṅkhāra dhamma is no-one conditioning for it, and arisen by natural conditions; it ceases by its nature and no one can stop it. Contemplate it with investigation and knowledge.

It’s not my breathing. Becoming cool and warm air is not my own creation. The warmth and coolness, pressure and expansion of this air are changing in sequence. They are arising and ceasing by themselves. Be mindful and aware the in and out air all the time contemplate with knowledge on the inconstant anicca) and non-self (anatta) nature of conditioned form (rūpa saṅkhāra). 

Continuing with the contemplation will see the khandha house (body). Like a robot with contemplative knowledge. Rapture (pīti) arises by discerning the dhamma nature (pīti Sambojjhaṅga—rapture factor for awakening). With rapture,  the mind becomes tranquil (passaddhi sambojjhaṅga).
 
With continued contemplation, discernment becomes better. As the air enters, the abdomen is rising and as the air exits, the abdomen is falling. The yogi contemplates the impermanence (anicca) and non-self (anatta) nature of the saṅkhāra dhamma of the earth (paṭhavī) and the wind (vāya). As time goes on, the discrimination becomes stronger and clearer. When the contemplative mind becomes calmer, yogi doesn't know about the abdomen, only knowing the changing nature of them. This earth element (abdomen) is also saṅkhāra dhamma (conditioned phenomenon). It's not me and mine. It functions by its nature. There is no person, being and soul which nature will yogi know with ñāṇa.

With the breathing, the air comes in and goes out, there are warmness and coolness (heat element), distention and pressure (wind element), rising and falling of the stomach (earth element). Yogi seeing their characteristics (i.e., inconstant, non-self) becomes stronger and the strength of effort (viriya sambojjhaṅga) increase. The in and out air process slowly becomes refined. With this refinement, a realization becomes clear. Yogi knows the heart is beating like a machine which is going on and on. With one beat of the heart, the khandha house vibrates once. The heart beating is going on at regular intervals without stopping, and at the same time the khandha house also vibrates in a subtle way. When this appears to the yogi, he should abandon the attention on the objects of in and out air and rising and falling of the abdomen and contemplate the heart beat and the vibration of the khandha house. This lifeless lumpy body is functioning by the power of kammic air (kammaja-vāya). It does its own job according to its nature. The non-self nature of the four elements is becoming clearer to the yogi. This is not me and not my khandha; not my conditioning, not existing as a soul. All these become clear to him.

The yogi by observing its nature just knowingly with each beating of the heart and from the blood vessels come the sounds when the blood rushing through them. He knows more about the nature of the body, it is like a robot. Looking at the blood rushing out from the blood vessels, it was like water flowing out from a water pipe. It was like a bag filled with water. It's only water element (liquid); not a human being, a person or a soul. These bloods are pushing out by the air element. Yogi also knows the warm element (heat) arises by each rushing out blood from the vessel. These are the nature of distention and pressure (air element), the flowing nature of water element and the warmness nature of heart element. It appears in the knowledge as the combination of elements, and the body is like a lump of elements. When over-viewing of the whole body, there are distention and pressure, coolness and warmness, rising and falling, beating of the heart with blood moving around. For the yogi, the nature of the dhamma of non-self characteristics and impermanent characteristics becomes clearer and clearer.

While sitting, the lower part of the body is afflicted or disturbed to varying degrees; it becomes hot, numb, sore, painful, etc. Because of the form (rūpa) changes, yogi experiences the oppressive nature of the body with pain (dukkha). All these phenomena are the dukkha-lakkhaṇa of the body. We feed our bodies with good food; take very good care of them in many ways, such as sleeping, bathing, etc. Finally, what is their nature?  It does not bring happiness, but rather supports the cruelty of the poisoned body to all beings. To get the khandha is attaining the cruel dukkha. Its task is cruelty. The yogi discerns the danger of the dukkha khandha. When observed tension, stiffness, numbness, soreness, pain, hardness, heaviness in nature, these are all in the process of changing from one to the other. These are the conditioning of the earth element (paṭhavī). Investigate them with knowledge as there is no person and being, man and woman or soul. 

From the body flowing out with sticky sweat (when sitting with a hot and humid climate). So it was like a water bag. Therefore, this body is the combination of elements more that look like a lump of chemical elements than a human being. With investigation and contemplation of all these phenomena in a longer time, yogi discerns the nature of form/body with more seeing, he sees the body dukkha and becomes disenchanted. With discernment of the non-self nature of the body, khandha becomes weariness to the body as mine. Whichever part of the body to contemplate can’t find any stability within it.

Again, when contemplating the foods we eat, the nutrition in it is not related to the four elements. Depending on the nutrition of the four elements, the body continues to survive and develop. Therefore, this body is not a human being, man or woman, it’s only the combination of the four elements. Only the four elements exist. There is no I-ness exists, nothing exists as mine, no existence of a soul. In this way, yogi has to contemplate the non-existence as non-existence until one's view is purified. 

Discernment of the four elements free from the concepts of body parts

With the support of the four elements, this body khandha (the combination of the 32 parts) exists, develops and changes. In the four elements there is no shape and form of head hairs, body hairs, flesh bone, etc. It's only existing as the changing nature of the four elements of matter (rūpa) phenomena. We are giving them the concepts of head hair, flesh, bone, etc. with languages by naming them. Only the four elements exist.

With knowledge (ñāṇa), contemplate and know these conceptual language of form and shape as not really exist. In the same way, yogi has to contemplate the external phenomena—such as, mountain tree, forest, earth, water, etc. Because of the naming of the conceptual knowledge or languages that different kinds of shape and form arise. If rūpa exists, it is only a change of the four elements. The conceptual form and shape are not real.
 
With the contemplation and discernment of the mind clinging to the body with the conceptual form and shape which do not exist as concepts are ceased, instead in the yogi's mind seeing the true nature (paramatā) of four elements as it's. Yogi continues to contemplate the real nature of the four elements a lot, then this khandha body becomes a big block of foam which appears to him. 

(U Candima continues to write about the impermanent nature of the body. We can read the process in his autobiographical and Dhamma talk in the book—“A Noble Search”. Here is a little bit in more detail.)

With the contemplation of the impermanence of the body for sometimes the mind arrives at a samādhi state which mentioned as follows:

At that time, the mind stays put among the form particles without a sense of perception (saññā) and the mind states with the concept of object ceases. 

The mind doesn't incline toward the external objects or one's physical body. That mind has no inclination or connection with them. The mind frees from the hindrances, and it becomes tranquil, peaceful and calm. This mind without any movement and the nature of wanting to contemplate any object come to cessation. 

The mind with its original state can see and know the nature of form (rūpa) without the concepts of hot tense, numb or painful, etc. This tranquil mind also can contemplate the arising of the mind contact (mano-samphassa) which inclines toward the four elements (rūpa). From there it also sees the nature of feeling [i.e., the contemplative mind discerns mind and form (nāma and rūpa)]. It arrives at the stage of the knowledge of the discernment of mind and form (nāma-rūpa pariccheda ñāṇa). Now practice is contemplation of the four elements without any prior samādhi, with the discernment knowledge (ñāṇa) and the identity view to form (the body) will cease. But the contemplative mind doesn’t see the mind feeling and  dejection (domanassa) will arise. For these domanassa minds to cease; yogis can do the meditation on mind (nāma-kammaṭṭhāna), i.e., no. 4 and no. 5 meditations (these are bhavaṅga meditations—refer to lying down and sitting postures. I had already mentioned them in the Noble Search).

Note: Meditations on the 32 body parts and the four elements here can be called wisdom develops samādhi which was mentioned by Luanta Maha-Bua in the book “Wisdom Develops Samādhi—A guide to the practice of the Buddha's meditation methods”. It was similar to the Ven. Ānanda's teaching in the Yuga-naddha Sutta—insight develops samādhi (see this book on  https://forestdhamma.org/books/). These two meditations are very important for humans in today’s world. Their self view or selfishness (diṭṭhi) and craving or lust (taṇhā) are stronger than ever before, even no limits. There is another way of practice—samādhi develops wisdom which mostly used by the Thai forest tradition—i.e., develop samādhi first with ānāpānasati and with this samādhi power contemplate 32 body part and the four elements lead to wisdom (paññā).

6. Mahāpallaṅka meditation or Diamond meditation

(Nāma Kammaṭṭhāna)

(In my book—the Noble Search, I mentioned in general on this meditation with the title Diamond Meditation. Therefore, I will not mention it again. Here I will only write some important points from the book—“The way to Stream Entry”.)

This practice is cutting off (samuccheda) taṇhā from painful feeling (dukkha vedanā). The yogi can only do this practice after the no. 4 and no. 5 meditations. These practices do not totally abandon the cause of taṇhā to dukkha vedanā by cutting off (samuccheda).

Now this mahapallaṅka practice is exposed the vāna-taṇhā which creates the four woeful khandha existences (apāya khandhas) in the worldlings. It is based on the dukkha vedanā and vāna-taṇhā arise from the mahapallaṅka (full-lotus posture)  meditation, and then pull out the root of this taṇhā and cut it off with the contemplation. From another point of view, as a vipassanā yānika, he is completely renouncing greed and affliction (abhijjhā and domanassa) based on dukkha vedanā. This is cutting off the coarse defilement of the worldling. It is impossible to cut off the latent defilement (anusaya) without first cutting off the coarser and finer defilement.

Someone can't sit full-lotus, no need to practise it. This posture and the practice are running away from the four vipers as mentioned in the Āsīvisopama Sutta and throwing out the frog (i.e., dosa) from the ant-hill (i.e., the body) in the Vammika S. The worldling is clinging to the body and mind as my body and my mind. At the time, of death, it will disturb the person, and he will become unbearable and uncontrollable. With this practice before death comes to expose and clear away this dosa mind from its root. From the worldling's point of view, the practice seemed to be quite frightening (i.e., too hard and tough). But if the yogis follow the teacher's instruction exactly and practice with the five strengths (saddha, viriya, sati, samādhi and paññā—i.e., the five spiritual faculties) it'll not be difficult.

[Note: According to U Candima's view, this is the only relatively quick and effective method for a vipassanā yānika yogi to completely eliminate the coarser and finer dosa and lobha kilesa arising from the latent irritation (paṭigha-ānusaya) and the identity view (sakkaya-diṭṭhi) from the sensation of physical pain. This is to directly kill (extinguish) kilesa with contemplation. Before him, many other teachers taught the method of indirectly killing kilesa—that is not allowing vedanā to connect taṇhā, see the 12 links of paṭiccasamuppāda. In Mogok Sayadaw's talks on Nandakovāda Sutta, he mentioned that it was better to cut taṇhā directly.

In his nine days retreat, U Candima gave some instructional talks to yogis. Some of them had discussions on yogis’ practice and experience. Some of the yogis had achievements to this stage.]

With normal faith (Saddha) and desire (chanda) it's impossible to extinguish sakkaya-diṭṭhi with kilesa dukkha which arise from bodily painful feeling of the afflicted elements. It can be only practised by yogis who have the strong four right effort (ātapi-sammappadhāna) and completed with faith and desire, not by ordinary man. If the approach is correct and there is strong belief, you will succeed. This is impossible for a yogi in his practice lacking with the five powers of faith, effort, mindfulness, samādhi and paññā. 

This practice is a good method for totally extinguishing the pain of death. If someone wants to know how to die, to have a good rebirth, to be free from the four painful existences (apāyabhūmi), to exchange the pleasures of the senses for the peace of Nibbāna; then this goal can definitely be achieved through this practice.

Using diamond samādhi contemplate paramatā mind and form
Note: At the first stage of citta-visuddhi there are six meditations: (1) ānāpāna (2) 32 body parts (3) four great elements (4) bhavaṅga with lying posture (5) bhavaṅga with sitting posture and (6) diamond or mahāpallaṅka.

A yogi can choose any one of the first three meditations—ānāpāna, 32 parts or the four elements. And then he has to practise (4), (5) and (6) successively. After the yogi attains the first stage of samādhi continues this practice and also the next following one—kāyanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna.

After the yogi adjust his sitting posture rightly and properly with awareness (sati) do not enjoy the pleasant mind state at the bhavaṅga which is cool and clear.

During the contemplation, yogi should not make any sensual worldly concepts to the experiences. Instead, with only knowing and observing the arising phenomena on their intrinsic nature as it is. It’s like watching a play, only not like being a participant on stage. It is like in the no. 5 meditation (sitting in bhavaṅga practice) practice contemplate the arising minds, then it'll cease. And then other minds will arise again. All these minds also are watching with sati. Have to be contemplated in this way. When the four elements are disturbed or afflicted, the mind will incline toward it. This is without one's intention, but a cause that lets the mind incline toward the afflicted place (rūpa). Watch and observe this cause. If a hot sensation of form arises and one knows that it is as hotness, that is wrong seeing. The hotness is the perception of the mind (saññā) and does not belong to the form (rūpa). It's the mind with a worldly sensual concept. Form (rūpa) is not hotness. Form only exposes its afflicted nature. You have to contemplate its intrinsic nature of true existence.

When with sati just contemplate their intrinsic nature which expose to the yogi and the mind (ñāṇa) seeing its intrinsic nature that (i.e., kāyanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna) the naming of hotness which is not its true nature will cease. If you abandon its true nature, then the following mind will arise with the perception of hotness.

The form will change one by one and from one place to another. Keep away from concept and continue the contemplation. Don't follow one's desire for a place for contemplation. Also contemplate the inclined nature characteristic of the mind. Even though the four elements are disturbed, there is no suffering. Don’t limit the time of contemplation.

When contemplate for sometimes, yogi can contemplate the inclination nature which leads the mind to from one rūpa (form) to one rūpa and from one place to one place (cittanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna). This is mind contact (mano-samphassa) inclined toward the afflicted form (rūpa). It's a mental formation (saṅkhārakkhandha, the 4th aggregate of the five khandhas). Continue to contemplate, and observe with knowledge (ñāṇa) to the inclined mind, what it is doing. At that time, at the bhavaṅga place it experiences the nature of the object (i.e., feeling—vedanā) This is vedananupassanā satipaṭṭhāna. After the yogi can contemplate the nature of feeling as much as he likes and abandons the nature of feelings.

Then continue to meditate on the nature of vedanā as my feeling. If the following mind is with dukkha vedanā, domanassa mind (mind with dejection) arises. If the following mind has suffering (dukkha vedanā), domanassa mind (mind with frustration) arises. If there is pleasant feeling, then somanassa mind (mind with joy) arises (cittanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna). When contemplating the nature of vedanā (without adding any concepts), the mind states of somanassa and domanassa cease and exist as neutral feelings (upekkhā-vedanā). 

[This point is good for reflection on the mind which is like a magician and deceives living being with diṭṭhi-taṇhā in the whole round of existences with immeasurable sufferings.]

Continue to develop the practice until the yogi easy to contemplate the nature of mind and form.

From here, the yogi can continue with the 2nd stage of purification of mind—citta-visuddhi. At the above stage if the yogi not able to contemplate and see the affliction (i.e., form); inclination of mind (mano-samphassa); feeling (vedanā) of mind and form, he will be sure able to contemplate and see them at the 2nd stage of purification.

From mahāpallaṅka to kāyanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna
Yogi continue practising with diamond meditation for 4–5 times after attaining diamond samādhi (mahāpallaṅka), there are no more desire to correct the body arise in the mind, instead mind with happiness only and no more pains appear. Yogi sits in normal posture or half-lotus posture. Don't enjoy the happiness of a clear mind. Take it as a contemplative object and contemplate it with equal sati for 15 or 20 minutes. At that time, this clear element, cool element, empty element becomes more distinct. It becomes distinct and discards the object (not paying attention to it), and then takes the object of bone at one's sitting body—for example, at the skull or chest bone, looking at it and not concentrating intensely and not contemplating with the perception of "bone, bone". It was like looking at the bones, on one's hand, the skeleton will appear. Yogi can discern the bone because from the mahapallaṅka practice the coarse defilement are extinguished and attain the purified mind. Some yogis discern all the bones.

This is not seeing with the eyes, but with the mind eye or knowledge eye (ñāṇa). If the seeing is becoming powerful and spreading the attention on flesh, intestine, liver, etc. and will see them distinctly. With this knowledge (ñāṇa) open one's eyes and looking at the external of human, dog, cat, etc. someone who develops the bones only seeing the skeleton, develop on the intestine only seeing the intestine. On the present object of a human being, not seeing as human being and not knowing as human being. Seeing a human being without being a human being, that is, without the existence of a man and a woman. There is no man and woman, i.e., there is not the existence of father, mother, son, daughter, etc. Also, one cannot cling to oneself as human, man, woman, etc. On the form (rūpa), the coarser wrong view (diṭṭhi) falls off, and thus taṇhā becomes less and less.

We can practise Dhamma with any method which is in accordance with the noble eightfold path. Any yogi who takes sensation (vedanā) as working-ground (kammaṭṭhāna); who has not reached the bhavaṅga samādhi, who has not analytically discerned the characteristics of the highest quality of form (paramatā rūpa), the inclination of the mind (mano-samphassa), and the sensations of the mind, has not yet reached the realm of insight (vipassanā). We have to take this point in mind. The meaning of this point is cutting off the painful bodily feeling of a worldling. The latent wrong view (diṭṭhi-ānusaya) has to be cut off with supramundane path.

Abandonment by knowledge at the first stage of purity of mind

(1) Different naming concepts (nāma-paññatti) of head, body, hand, feet, hotness, tenseness, stiffness, etc.

(2) Shapes and forms of human, man, woman, etc.

(3) On the inclination of the mind (mano-samphassa) to objects as I am looking at it (i.e., wrong view)

(4) On the experiences (i.e., vedanā) or feelings to the objects as I experience or feel it [i.e., wrong view (diṭṭhi)].

(5) Don't want to feel the disturbances of the four element (vipariṇāma), i.e., dosa.

(6) Want to condition the body when painful (i.e., lobha).

Objects able to contemplate at this stage

(1) 32 body parts, the four elements

(2) the afflicted paramatā form (rūpa) and the mind inclination (mano-samphassa) from the bhavaṅga to the afflicted form (i.e., discernment of mind and form)

(3) afflicted paramatā form and the experience of this form (i.e., discernment of mind and form).

(4) the sitting posture becomes stable, even sitting for a long period (e.g., 10 hours) with the disturbances of the four elements and wanting to change (cetanā) the body not arising by itself. Thus, the kilesa enemies of the coarser dosa do not arise in the ongoing practice. This is the great benefit (this is the very important point for all yogis).

Things not able to do or abandon at this stage

(1) If the yogi not contemplate the afflictions (form) as it's and let it at the bhavaṅga and take the object of the body house and looking at it, the 32 body parts of head, body, etc. with its shapes and signs of concepts and hotness, coolness, tenseness, etc. of conceptual signs are still there.

(2) Even with the first "bhavaṅga samādhi" and being able to contemplate the objects associated with it, sometimes the mind becomes bored and restless, not wanting to sit down again, impatience and other emotions remain.

(3) Not yet seeing the particles of rūpa.

(4) the six clear base elements (eye, ear, etc.), the six sense objects (sight, sound, etc.), the six consciousness (viññāṇa), the six contacts (phassa), etc. are still not discern yet (i.e., the six sets of six in the Chachakka Sutta, Majjhima Nikāya).

Note: At the first stage of practice, the mind falls into bhavaṅga, it will be called as first bhavaṅga samādhi.

The first stage of purity of mind will be called the first stage of purity.
(These are U Candima's designation)

Second stage of purification of the mind
Keeping the mind from greed and distress (abhijjhā and domanassa) for two hours

Yogi has completed with the first stage of samādhi even though he can contemplate the afflicted form (paramatā rūpa), the inclination of the mind and its experience (mano-samphassa and vedanā), their impermanent process is not coming to the end. The mind is still not in purity yet. The kilesas of not being abandoned are stimulating the mind, and its āsavas want to flow out. Don't want to continue insight, become lazy and bored, want to go here and there, want to do this and that. During the sitting, sometimes the mind does not contemplate the visible paramatā mind and form, instead, it wants to associate with the conceptual object. The mind also doesn't want to sit longer is not because it can't bear the object of afflicted four elements. It's the cause of the mild kilesas (pariyuṭṭhāna). So the contemplative mind is not calm.

The above-mentioned mind again becomes the khandhas of obsession with the respective objects. These states of mind are in parallel with the hindrances. Therefore, seeing them as dangers, yogi re-contemplates these clinging minds.

Each time you have to contemplate their arising and cessation (anicca). Because the mind with worldly sensual conceptual objects is still not free from perceptions (saññā) of these conceptual objects. Therefore, yogi who wants to contemplate the worldly paramatā mind and form of the six sets of six  still cannot take the objects (i.e., his mind is still covered with worldly sensual concepts so that he cannot see the paramatā object of mind and form in the six sets of six discourse).  The inability to see these paramatā dhammas means that the mind has not been purified. On the arising dhammas of sahetu viññāṇa, the mental factors (cetasikas) of delusion (moha), unwholesome dhammas are not purified yet (sahetu viññāṇa refers to both wholesome and unwholesome mind consciousness). This unpurified mind is only taking the worldly sensual concepts. From latent defilement, craving (taṇhā) wanting to flow out with this sensual concept develop to mild kilesa and citta-saṅkhāra are arising again. (Citta-saṅkhāra is the term of perception and feeling—saññā and vedanā.)

The mind takes the object of paramatā and must be empty with concepts.  Here yogi does not contemplate any form (rūpa: sight, sound, etc. five external objects and all the objects of smoke, form, sign matter, etc.). If the worldlings take the objects of form (rūpa) always include worldly sensual concepts with them. Therefore, now practice is freeing the mind from concepts.

Now the yogis have abandoned the anger of the toad in accordance with the Vammika Sutta, and selected the vipassanā yānika way. He is arriving at the stage of the practice to free the mind from the hindrances (i.e., throw out the sieve in the Sutta) for sometimes (vikkhambhana—around 10 hours). This stage is to abandon the hindrances with greed and delusion (abhijjhā and moha). Yogi continues to do the practice with animitta—cetosamādhi method. There is a question. This is the possibility of practicing with animitta-cetosamādhi (i.e. stable samādhi without mental signs or images) without being based on jhāna.

This vipassanā yānika method without based on samatha-nimittas is already abandoned the bodily pains (dukkhindriya) from severe suffering (domanassa—mental suffering) which disturbs the samādhi in violent way (i.e., with the first bhavaṅga). There is no mental suffering from the khandha dukkha even if the yogi sits for a longer period.

The kilesas that still exist are:

| (1) laziness (kosajja)—don't want to practice, laid down the duty
| (2) look for sense objects (vitakka)—thinking this and that
| (3) reflecting on different objects (vicāra)—reflect on the objects of thought
| (4) like the pleasant objects (pīti)
| (5) stick on the pleasant object with happiness (sukha)
| (6) restlessness (uddhacca)—not stay with one object
| (7) in sloth and torpor (thina and middha)
| (8) worry (kukkucca)
| (9) concern (byāpāda)
| (10) can't make decision (vicikiccha)
| 

The above mental states arise because the mind lacks sati. These impurities of defilement are happening in the mind. Therefore, have to contemplate the mind with mind (i.e., cittanupassanā or nāma kammaṭṭhāna).

[Note: Mogok Sayadaw's cittanupassanā is also in this way purified the mind with developing vipassanā Samādhi. ]

When the mind with laziness arises, contemplate it with the following sati mind, then the preceding mind ceases (i.e., lazy mind). All the other mental states from (2) to (10) also contemplate in this way.

Keeping with sati becomes stronger and the mind with sati sees all the preceding minds (i.e., kilesas) have been leased. Sati becomes stable as the preceding mind states arise, fewer and fewer. With the lack of sati, it will appear again. Irritation of the mind (domanassa) does not arise (because of the factor of suffering), and sati can contemplate all the arising of the previous mind without deviation (because the previous first stage of purity has overcome it). Therefore, the contemplative mind discerns the cessation nature of the phenomena. Yogi continues the contemplation of the cessation of minds, not their arising. 

If we analyze the nature of this contemplation, the four jhanic factors of vitakka, vicāra, pīti, and sukha cease. The mind with the five hindrances has ceased. There is no mind taking the object of form (rūpa), and the sensual mind (kāma) that has ceased. There is no mind that depends on sense objects; the mind is stopped for this or that sense object. All kinds of sense objects are not there that the external bases are ceased (bahiddhāyatana). Don't take the form (rūpa) on the body as an object, so that the awareness of heat, tightness, numbness, pain, feet, hands, body, head, vibration, etc., all stop. Therefore, only taking the cessation of the object that worldly sensual concepts with citta-saṅkhāra are ceased.

If you do not take the concept or nimitta as the object, the concept with thought (saññā with paññatti-nimitta; thought with giving names) will be temporarily stopped (tadaṅga) or stopped for a period of time (vikkhambhana, suppressed and broken).

This is animitta-ceto samādhi.

In the Mahāvedalla Sutta, Cūḷayamakavagga, Mūlapaṇṇāsapāli, Majjhima N. (MN 43), we find this passage:

“Friend, what is the signless deliverance of mind (samāpatti)? 
Friend, in this teaching (sāsana), the monk does not pay attention to all (objects) signs, enters and abides in the concentration of the mind without signs.  Friend, this kind of abiding is the singless deliverance of mind”

According to the Sutta, all the signs (objects) mean all the worldly conceptual objects from the six sense-doors with their signs. To discern the worldly paramatā signs (lokiya-paramatā nimitta) or saṅkhāra nimittas, the contemplating mind must transcend the worldly conceptual signs, because the paramatā dhammas have no concepts. Therefore, the mind wants to take paramatā signs and must be freed from the sign of concepts.

[Note: Here we can see the wisdom of the enlightened mind. Some of U Candima students who are also scholars helped him to write the book—the Way to Stream Entry, checking his explanations on the practice with the suttas and they found the same as mentioned there.]

The nature of samatha yānika way is taking the object of sign with jhanic factors and developing the practice. Vipassanā yānika is the establishment of samādhi by the object of "cessation" without the "sign". The interpretation of vipassanā yānika is the establishment of a samādhi which is able to contemplate the āyatana paramatā objects (see the Chachakka Sutta). According to the Mahāvedalla Sutta, all mundane conceptual signs mean that the mind with these signs ceases when no attention is paid to the six sense objects of the "form dhamma". With sati, contemplate the mind which pays attention to the 6-sense objects and the mind with the object is ceased. The perception with the conceptual sign is ceased. It is free from the 6-sens objects that the mind with sati is staying at the cessation with no conceptual sign. To remain alert in this cessation and to keep sati stable there, in this way is to establish samādhi or to free the mind from hindrances. Here the 2nd and third stages of purification of mind are establishing Samādhi by using the practice of the cessation of the conceptual signs.

With the continuous contemplation of the preceding minds that bodily, verbal and mental actions (kamma) with the unwholesome and wholesome minds related to worldly sensuality (lokiyakāma) are coming to cessation. This contemplating mind becomes one-pointed samādhi (ekaggatā samādhi) at the cessation of object. At that time, sati became strong as a faculty of mindfulness (satindriya). Yogi has to practice until the samādhi becomes the faculty of samādhi (samādhi-indriya). The mind completed with samādhi-indriya becomes the purity of mind. Its quality is equal to the 4th rūpa jhāna (i.e., at the 3rd stage of purification or the 3rd bhavaṅga samādhi).

Whatever method the yogi practises to arrive at the noble path factors, he has to achieve the samādhi-indriya as mentioned above is the only goal. To arrive there-

(1) Directly contemplate the minds with worldly sensual concepts to keep it away, or

(2) Contemplate the arising and passing away of feeling for the 2nd stage of purification of mind.

The 2nd Stage of Purification / Keeping Away the Conceptual Objects 
(the first method)

In the beginning, practise together with walking meditation. Sit for three hours and walk for two hours. Walking meditation is only support to the sitting, when sati becomes stronger and purified, abandon the walking. And then at least sit for five hours. With the lesser hours, it doesn't become samādhindriya.

With the success of the first stage of purification, kilesa arise from the afflicted four great elements are ceased and fallen into bhavaṅga. After that yogi doesn't want to sit longer, the mind becomes restless with objects, etc., these minds arise with worldly sensual concepts. Mindful to these states of mind. It's the mind contemplating the mind. The contemplative mind contemplates only, and the yogi must not notice perceptions (sañña) such as rising and falling, anicca, dukkha, anatta, etc. Also, do not contemplate with expectation; do not float and associate with the arising tainted (āsava) minds; don't contemplate the preceding minds with the desire of wanting them to arise and fall. 

At the contemplation of the preceding minds, when they appear, contemplation can only be done with the desire to recognize them. With contemplation, the preceding mind will disappear. We should not take seeing the rise and fall of the preceding mind as seeing the rise and fall of the mind or discerning dhamma. These minds with taṇhā, māna, and diṭṭhi are still not in themselves objects of insight. This is taking away the conceptual objects which like kilesa algae and dirt which cover up the mind.

[Note: Here is a controversial point that can arise related to some views before U Candima. He never accepts a view as true insight if the contemplative mind still has not arrived at the level of samādhi-indriya or ekaggatā samādhi yet.]

During the contemplation of different mind states, after knowing each mind state clearly, then contemplate them (e.g., the mind wanting to look for an object, thinking, etc.). As long as there is contemplation, it disappears. With the relaxation of sati, the mind arises again. With mindfulness arising again, the former mind stops. During the contemplation, one should not contemplate at the chest area where it arises. Only contemplate with ñāṇa_knowledge (mind to mind only, not to the place which it arises).

In this way, with more awareness, try to contemplate each mind that arises. The reason for asking the yogi to contemplate for five hours is that the unpurified mind does not want to stay longer on one object; it has the nature of restlessness, of being free to look for new objects. It doesn't want to stay on one object quietly. As a result, the mind becomes more lethargic, bored, and not wanting to contemplate as time goes on. Yogi wants to follow one's desire, mind arises. Yogi’s mind wanting to follow his desire arises. Not following all these mind states and with more awareness to know them as objects of contemplation (i.e., not get lost in them). If these kilesa states of mind exist, you can't discern the refined paramatā mind and form at the present moment. Therefore, asking the yogis to sit for longer hours has good reason.

What this reveals is pariyuṭṭhāna kilesa, i.e., delicate or mild defilement. The mind doesn't want to stay calm, wants to disperse around, etc. and these hindrances must be ceased in order to facilitate the practice (then the mind becomes purified for insight). Yogis do not discern the other paramatā dhammas of mind and form in the Chachakka Discourse; that is caused by delicate or mildly defiled impurities (such as moha, etc.). Not letting the unwholesome mental states stick with the mind by observing sīla and practising the samādhi kammaṭṭhāna straightforwardly is purifying the mind with path factors (i.e., sati and samādhi factors = six factors).

What the yogis must understand is that as long as the mind wanders within the confines of worldly concepts, it can never acquire the paramatā object of mind and form that is free from those concepts. Therefore, it is further from taking the object of transcendental paramatā Nibbāna (lokuttara paramatā Nibbāna) which is free from worldly concepts and worldly paramatā mind and form. With this practice, if sati becomes stronger, increase the sitting to at least 8 or 9 hours. Every time, the preceding mind arises and contemplates regularly without fail. With a lot of contemplation, less and less mind is generated, and then the mind in contemplation is empty, without an object. If this happens, do not expect the next arising mind and pay attention to the empty cessation of nature with no present of mind. It means only the contemplative mind exists. With sati and ñāṇa pay attention to the nature of cessation with no mind object and the nature of clearness and coolness can arise. If these appear, do not pay attention to them, but only contemplate the nature of cessation with sati in a "no mind (object)" way.

He gave an example of a man with some money in his pocket to go shopping. This person didn't know how much money he had. During the shopping process, all the money was used, but he didn't know it. Then he continued to a shop and bought a thing and put his hand in his pocket for the money, then he knew there was no money left. This man when he put his hand into the pocket didn't pay attention to the hand and the pocket, but the emptiness of the money. It was, like this example, the yogi's contemplating mind only pays attention to the nature of cessation with sati and contemplates without naming the experience. When the practice becomes stronger, yogi knows the preceding mind objects with its concepts come to cessation one by one. Don't take this as the knowledge of dissolution (bhavaṅgañāṇa). It's just conceptual objects that stop in the mind. This is also not the cessation of Saṅkhāra dhamma which is Nibbāna. This cessation or no mind nature is the cessation of minds with worldly sensual concepts (lokiya-kāma-paññatti). Even though these states of mind cease, it still can't take the objects of paramatā mind and form (the mind is still at the 2nd stage of purification).

[Note: There is a controversial point arising here. Before U Candima's time, dry insight of vipassanā yānika practice using momentary samādhi (khaṇika samādhi) develops insight. For him, this is still not true insight because it doesn’t have the strength to develop true insight. According to his instruction, it was still in the stage of purification of mind.]

Now, the unwholesome mental states that arise in the mind are becoming fewer or very weak. Wholesome mental states with sati are defending and looking after the mind from unwholesome mental states to arise. This is practising of purification virtue and mind together (i.e., sīla and citta-visuddhis). If the yogi misses one sati on the object of cessation and a worldly sensual concept of mind with moha arises.

With a regain of sati the object of mind ceases. Sati must be continuously stayed with the object of cessation. If the mind of worldly sensual concept arise again and don't pay attention to it, only staying in the cessation. For at the same moment, while acquiring sati, the object of the mind stops by itself. This is asking to stay with the cessation directly with sati. Continue to stay with the cessation with sati (It's really not an easy practice).

With early desire of sati the mind becomes coarse, and not lead to samādhi.  Excessive effort can cause the mind to behave roughly and destroy samādhi. If sati is not purified it becomes moha and the object of the sensual conceptual mind reappears. It's not possible with over faith and effort (saddha and viriya). In this way, we can contemplate the cessation with constant sati and knowing and cessation with knowing, but we do not chant with the mind.

The yogi continues the practice until the contemplating mind becomes clean and has strength and sati with calmness is able to stay in the nature of cessation. Do not make the restriction of the time hours if sati becomes strong. The reason for practicing in this way is to expose impurities—such as the mind that gets lazy and bored over time; the mind that doesn't want to practice in a straight way; the mind that doesn't want to stay on one object; the mind with sloth and torpor; the mind that wants to give up, and so on.

With great exertion, to practice for longer 8–9 hours is fulfilling the faculties of mindfulness and samādhi (satındriya and samādhindriya). Sati must stay with the cessation with no any disturbances. When a yogi arrives at the stage of clean and stable samādhi and in the chest area, a sensation will arise. It could make the yogi feel a little frightened (e.g., like someone riding on a chair in the Ferris wheel when it comes down from the height.). Don't let it happen. This is the 2nd time falls into bhavaṅga (second bhavaṅga samādhi). Let the sati dwell with it, just as the sati stabilizes with the previous cessation. Let sati falls with bhavaṅga mind and staying in stability with the cessation as before. In this way, yogis have to practise until the mind falls into bhavaṅga, but don't expect with the desire of wanting it to happen. It becomes greed (lobha) and samādhi can be destroyed. In the practicing mind if the bad states of mind crept in with it can't realize Dhamma. The dhammas of highest quality  (Paramatā dhammas) are clean and purified, and are rising and falling quickly; therefore, the mind that has them as its object cannot have any black and filthy defilement. All yogis have to be careful about this point.

If a practicing yogi cannot sit for two hours during practice without talking and without movement, then there is no pleasure of sīla samādhi, magga and phala (Path and Fruit) because he cannot restrain the mind. It's not always sitting for (8-9) hours and only for the support of arriving at the end of purification of the mind which is right samādhi (samma-samādhi). If a yogi has reached samma-samādhi, he can practice in any posture. Changing the physical body (correction) means that the mind is in motion; it means destroying the faculties of the body and mind (kāya-indriya and mano-indriya). If the spiritual faculties are destroyed, he will not arrive at jhānas and not in accordance with the insight practice (i.e., not correcting the body). The paramatā objects are rising and falling in the present moment, and the yogi must be able to discern them. If the contemplative mind is rough without stability and purity, how can it discern them?

All yogis have to be careful about this point.

A yogi who has reached the second stage of purity should easily establish samadhi by stopping his mind on worldly sensual ideas.
 
It means his mind has to be stable with second bhavaṅga samādhi. After falling into bhavaṅga for one time and get up again; and next time for sitting, as soon as establish the physical faculty there will be two times of falling into bhavaṅga following each other.

When a yogi is arriving at this nature, his contemplating mind is unable to pay attention to the shape and form of the physical body. Therefore, there are no minds arising with the perception of head, body, hand, feet, tension, numbness, pain, etc.

Also, it can't take the objects of colour, light, smoke, darkness, etc. At the 2nd stage of bhavaṅga samādhi, there are no clinging minds arising with taṇhā, māna and diṭṭhi and cling to the objects. With the falling of bhavaṅga, one just know and be mindful and let the mind stays with the cessation. At that time, the mind with sensual concepts does not happen. The mind with thinking, planning and giving names are ceased. When one falls into "bhavaṅga samadhi", one is able to be skillfully and steadily in the "cessation" for one hour (i.e., skillful in second "bhavaṅga samadhi"), and to come out from "cessation" to experience one's body with sati and knowledge (ñāṇa), and to discern that the very refined particles (kalāpa) are changing with dissolution. If the yogi doesn't want to contemplate these kalāpas, then abandon them and contemplate the mind which knows the kalāpas, and the mind ceases.

In this way, the mind stays with the cessation for (8-9) hours, with sometimes after 2½ to 3 hours the mind with sensual concepts able to arise. This is because after a long period of time sati becomes weak and mind with sensual concepts leading by moha back again, but with quick sati coming back again it ceases. Yogi continues with the contemplation on the cessation with clear sati.

Comparing this second stage practice with the four vipers discourse: After freeing from the four vipers, the convict continued to run from the five murderers who were chasing him. The clinging minds which disturb the contemplating minds are like the five murderers. The samādhi staying with the 2nd fallen bhavaṅga was like a place free from the five murderers. The mind with clinging of five khandhas or the objects of mind do not arise that there is no passing away of them, so rising and falling come to end. It ceases to be a mind with concepts and becomes a mind of contemplation without concepts.

The cessation of minds with clingings is only by sīla and samādhi (not insight or paññā). The clinging object of form (rūpa) ceases: the four mind khandhas (namakkhandha) with the object of form also cease.

[Note: Here a controversial point can arise. Before U Candima—some teachings of insight mentioned as the ending of rising and falling (i.e., aniccas) is Nibbāna. Other systems don't mention it in as much detail as he does, which can be questionable at this point. ]

Before the bhavaṅga samādhi, yogi contemplates with knowledge (ñāṇa) knowing the rising and falling of unwholesome mental states (minds) with clingings. After the bhavaṅga and at the moment of samādhi the five clinging of khandhas cease. At that time, with the cessation of kilesas which make the mind unstable is not there and the mind becomes purified. It doesn’t take any object of form that the mind with perception (saññā) which gives the names of concepts has ceased. With the cessation of the mind process which takes the objects of worldly sensual concept ceasing that bhavaṅga falls in for the 2nd time. The contemplative mind becomes refined. With fewer unwholesome mental states, the mind becomes clean and tidy without coarseness. With less dispersion, the mind stays at the present moment. The mind taking the objects of past and future has ceased, but still not completely stable.

A yogi with the mahāpallaṅka (diamond) practice and attains samādhi can't discern the afflicted form, inclination of the mind and feeling (vedanā), now with the 2nd bhavaṅga samādhi contemplate only the cessation with sati for an hour. And sati is stable and calm at the cessation. When sati becomes calm and relaxed a little, concentrate mindful on cessation and look at it with sati only. What is meant here is that the cessation will continue on its own; or it will arise with the contact of external objects with the mind, but the yogi can easily see the cessation without controlling it. This nature is called samādupekkhā (samādhi-upekkhā = equanimity to samādhi) At the time, when the affliction of four elements arise, a mind will arise from the cessation with the inclination toward the affliction (samādhi mind also not stable and changing one by one). Yogi just contemplates at it with equanimity. He will surely discern the connection between form (afflicted rūpa) and feeling by observing the inclination.

The supreme happiness of paths and fruits is not something that can be achieved casually. For any yogi to be successful in his practice, he must put in the proper effort and energy to accomplish the elements required for it. (Buddha mentioned them in the Suttas, but most contemporary monks and yogis take it as an easy way and even distorted the Dhamma.)

Developing Samādhi With the Contemplation on                             Rises And Falls of Vedanā
(the 2nd method)

Yogis who have discerned the afflicted rūpa, the inclination of the mind and feeling (vedanā) with the scales like samādhi and mahāpallaṅka practices have to practise the 2nd stage of samādhi in the same way.

Every time when the form (rūpa) is afflicted, yogi contemplates the characteristic nature of the mind's experiences (i.e., vedanā). Following the nature of mind and form (nāma-rūpa) with contemplation, the arising of forms are never ending. The tendency of the mind does not end with arising, nor does the nature of the feelings (vedanās) of the mind. The yogi is discerning them. Forms are arising all the time by changing from one kind to one kind and from one place to one place. The mind is changing all the time by feeling it. After feeling it, the cause and effect connection comes to end.

Yogi with his knowledge knows the mind continuously taking a new object and feeling it and stops with ending there (at vedanā). So the yogi continues the contemplation of feeling with its characteristic of ending. He is establishing samādhi by contemplating the mind feeling nature; taking the mind for the object of samādhi.

He is contemplating the only nature of the mind feels and then disappears, feels and disappears, etc: When contemplating with sati continuously the nature of feeling arises and knowing it (or) appears and knowing it, etc., and then also he knows the mind's nature of feeling as its rise and fall and the nature of cessation. The yogi is able to stay at the cessation of vedanākkhandha; he is knowing the place of cessation. When with sati keeping it calmly and evenly on the cessation nature of vedanākkhandha and falls into bhavaṅga for the 2nd time. The meaning here is the mind contact (mano-samphassa) inclining toward external objects come to cease that the mind process taking the object of afflicted form (rūpa) also come to cessation and the mind falls into bhavaṅga. The contemplating mind knows the cessation and is in tune with it. (i.e. samādhi). 

Objects of Contemplation Able to Discern With the 2nd Samādhi
and the Benefits

After fall into the 2nd bhavaṅga mind, yogi continues with sati staying with the cessation of the mind (i.e., mūla-kammaṭṭhāna). At the cessation for three hours, the strength of sati becomes weak and moha sticks back unknowingly. The mind with weariness and effort becomes weak and is able to arise. If there is an association with a clinging object, it will encounter an enemy. In one's own knowledge, yogi knows that he is still not discerning the paramatā mind and form. Therefore, when the time spent on the cessation becomes longer, the sati becomes weaker and the waiting kilesas stick back to the mind. The yogi knows that one's sati is still not free from the control of the enemy. He sees the flaw of sati becoming vulnerable with time. Therefore, he has to continue the practice by not letting sati move away from the object of cessation. With sati and ñāṇa (nyan) stay with the cessation of conceptual object. Keeping the sati to the object with a bit more desire and mind process arises. If staying with the object of cessation without clearly and moha arises. If the nature of dissatisfaction arises, it becomes refined dosa. Here it's important to have very purified sati. There is not even any trace of dirt in the purified sati. Sometimes yogi has pleasantness on the clear mind, and also clear light can appear. He must give up the desire for these objects, only in the absence of other mind, stay on the cessation with sati and knowledge.

[Sayadaw U Candima gave the following instruction—how to develop the practice vigorously.]

Take care of your body's needs (i.e., wash your face, go to the bathroom and eat breakfast) from 5 to 6 a.m. and do walking meditation with sati. Do sitting meditation from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. if it's necessary. Continue the practice from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m. Take care of the bodily needs From 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. Continue the practice from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. Now it is arriving at the level of getting rid of the enemy completely, so yogis have to do the practice without getting up. The reason for the longer time is that after 3–4 hours the worldly sensual thinking comes in because the sati is unstable and unclean. Therefore, he has to practise vigorously until it's stable and clean with the cessation.

With more care, yogi must not let sati disappear.

During being mindful, yogi should not concern about the situation, it should be ignored; it is a worldly habit, an unwholesome mental factor (cetasika). With over effort, the mind wanders and bhavaṅga vibrates, which destroy samādhi. With weak sati, it becomes moha and conceptual mind arises again. Dosa arises from one's unsatisfied desires, and lobha arises by thinking about the desire to achieve. Check lobha, dosa and moha with paññā and do not let them stick together with sati, while paying attention to the nature of cessation and worldly sensual minds.

In practice, there are two groups of dhamma, i.e., form (rūpa) group and mind (nāma) group. The mind group is led by sahetu viññāṇa (unwholesome and wholesome mind consciousness). Defilement, hindrances and concepts (unwholesome) and sati, paññā are in this mind consciousness. Therefore, it's only using the sahetu mano-viññāṇa to contemplate sahetu viññāṇa. This is contemplating the preceding mind with the following mind. In what follows, U Candima compared the four ways of such contemplation (these refer to the four vipassanā systems).

1. The preceding mind (sahetu viññāṇa) with hindrances and anicca. The following contemplating mind (sahetu mano-viññāṇa) with sati contemplates the preceding mind as anicca and the preceding, mind ceases (at any one mind moment only one mind can exist). In this way, if the yogi can contemplate without gap and all the preceding mind with hindrances are ceased for temporary abandonment (tadaṅga vikkhambhana) (For example, if there is an hour in an hour of meditation). But these cessations cannot last for two hours, because when the body is afflicted with pain and soreness, dosa and domanassa come up and it becomes invalid.

2. Another way is the preceding mind with concepts (e.g., see an object, hear a sound, etc.).

	Next is the contemplative mind with concepts (e.g., seeing, seeing; hearing, hearing, etc.)

	When pains and aches arise, it doesn't last for two hours.

3. The preceding mind with concepts and the contemplating mind with concepts, which contemplates the preceding mind as if there is nothing. When pains and aches arise, it doesn't last for two hours.

4. The preceding mind with concepts and the contemplating mind with no concepts and has sati.

	In this system, sati can stay with the cessation at least for 8–9 hours without moving, even can be more than that. This is U Candima's way.

The above four ways of contemplation are the same. One, two, three practices are only temporary abandonment (tadaṅga) with sīla and samādhi, because they cannot abandon the faculty of pain (dukkhindriya) that in long term it fails. No. 4 practice is abandoned taṇhā from dukkha vedanā that it has no suffering and free from khandha dukkha (body pain but not the mind) and samādhi becomes stable.

The contemplating mind at the 3rd stage of samādhi, sati is clean with vīthi-citta (mind movement) and cannot have uncertainty of dust. It must be free from the past and future of conceptual objects, must not have all worldly perceptions (saññā). The mind must not have worldly sensual habits and behaviours. Sati and knowing are going together with stability. This is not letting the 14 unwholesome mental factors sticking with the mind during this samādhi (see Abhidhamma for these 14 akusala cetasikas). This knowing mind is called a purified mind. If the contemplating mind of the practising yogi does not possess the above-mentioned qualities, he cannot enter the state of insight knowledge with the knowledge of the three characteristics (lakkhaṇa ñāṇa). They must be considered for this (without becoming truly insightful).

When the purified, calm and stable sati is staying with stability at the nature of cessation and in the chest for the 3rd time, there is a refined feeling that arises. It's for the 3rd time the mind falls into bhavaṅga samādhi. As soon as it happens, the mind stays at the clear element of bhavaṅga. The clear bhavaṅga is the paramatā mind element. This is also the birthplace of the minds. The sati at the 3rd stage of bhavaṅga samādhi is not fading away again that in this Samādhi. The group of unwholesome mental factors are totally cased. It only has sati and paññā (knowledge—ñāṇa) [It seems to me that the sati and paññā referred to by the Thai forest monks could be this kind of samadhi. ]

Some yogi said, at this place there was only knowing existed. When the contemplating mind arrives at samādhi-indriya it becomes very refined. Because different kinds of worldly sensual concepts, worldly sensual minds, worldly sensual behaviour are totally ceased in this samādhi. Therefore, no impurities appear again to stick with the mind and during the samādhi 14 unwholesome mental factors are ceased. This cessation of the minds is not Nibbāna element. (This is done with the power of samādhi, not by wisdom—paññā. In other systems, this could be mistaken for Nibbāna.) There is no more reason to purify the mind. The mind can stay at the clear element of the bhavaṅga without moving.

A yogi stays with this samādhi frees from the five sense objects; and also from the past and future mind objects (dhamma-ārammaṇa). He also frees from the objects with lobha, dosa, moha and diṭṭhi kilesas for some periods (vikkhambhana).

Therefore, sahetu mind which is completed with right-samādhi (samma-samādhi) only taking the object of bhavaṅga. According to the Six sets of six Discourse (Chachakka Sutta, Majjhima N.) it was mentioned that yogi also had to discern the mind (māna or mano). Now this attainment of samādhi discerns the clear element of the mind (māna), because of this power of upekkhā ekaggatā-samādhi which just only taking the object of clear bhavaṅga that it can stay there as one's wishes the clear element is the sign (nimitta) with no concepts. It's free from the worldly sensual concepts of perception (saññā). It's completed with samādhi-indriya that frees from the defilement with perception which disturb this samādhi. Defilement signs are ceased in clear bhavaṅga. Therefore, it's free from the perceptions of signs. This samādhi frees from the desire of perception. Sensual objects (kāma-ārammaṇa) and defilement are ceased there, that it frees from the perception of wrong attention (ayonisomanasikāra).

It doesn't need to look after the defilement that is sīla-visuddhi (purity of virtue). With the cessation of the polluted defilement, the mind becomes pure, which is citta-visuddhi (purity of mind). The causes that make the mind shake disappears, and this is samādindriya (the faculty of samādhi).

It just stays on the clear bhavaṅga, and the mind and form processes that would arise in the present moment due to the contact of sense objects cannot arise there. The contemplating mind protects the bhavaṅga there, and the mind objects (dhamma-ārammaṇa) don't have the chances to arise. Because sahetu viññāṇa is completed with samādindriya which continuously inclining toward the clear bhavaṅga as an object. It stays with the bhavaṅga for many hours. 

The mind of this samādhi focuses only on observing the resemblance images presented in the "bhavaṅga" mind door, and will not accept any worldly conceptual objects. There is no "mind action" (citta-saṅkhāra) that takes worldly concepts as objects, and all mind action with transcendental (paramatā) "perceptions" about the object (the seeming images presented in the "bhavaṅga mind") does not exist in the mind. This can be said that there is no perception (saññā). It cannot be said that it does not exist at all, because if mind exists, perception also exists.

To continue the practice, yogi has to move away from the clear bhavaṅga and contemplate the paramatā objects. This is moving away from the abandoning of the six sense-doors (abandonment of six sense-doors is chaḷaṅgūpekkha). Yogi's contemplative mind must have completion with the quality of abandoning the six sense-doors to contemplate the nature of mind and form (rūpa). [This is the same as upekkhā ekaggatā samādhi, samādindriya, samma-samādhi, etc.]

In the Buddha's teaching (i.e., suttas), the luminous mind or bhavaṅga citta is at the moment of unwholesome active cognitive mind process (akusala citta vīthi) is defiled, and at the moment of wholesome active cognitive mind process (kusala citta free from defilement. Yogis have to be aware of this point in the Suttas. This third stage of samādhi or purity of mind is liberated from the defilement can stay at the clear bhavaṅga. Therefore, the practice mentioned here is in accordance with the Buddha's teaching.

Yogi has to come out from the clear bhavaṅga if he wants to develop great insight (mahā-vipassanā). He can discern the clear bhavaṅga that he can contemplate the arising phenomena which arisen by the contacts of objects from the five sense-doors at the five clear elements (pasāda) [these are sight, sound, etc. and eye clear element, ear clear element, etc.] According to the Chachakka Sutta he can discern the six pairs of clear elements.

Sayadaw U Candima's view: There are many basic meditation objects, such as at the top of the head; noting at the rise and fall of the abdomen; contemplate the preceding mind and the following mind (i.e., contemplative mind); doing ānāpāna with strong breathing or soft breathing; practising with momentary samādhi (khaṇika samādhi); practising with dry insight system (suddha vipassanā); etc. Teachers are using all these methods or systems to teach and instruct yogis to practice these methods (in Burma). If yogis still do not discern the six pairs of clear elements and the six consciousnesses, it means that their discernment is still not true and correct. (This problem does not arise in the Thai forest tradition, which follows the sutta tradition without confusion. See the tradition of Ajahn Mun and the teachings of Ajahn Chah.
Comparison with the four vipers discourse
The practices from the 2nd bhavaṅga to third bhavaṅga can be compared as follows. Falling into the 2nd bhavaṅga is free from the five murderers (the five khandhas) and continue to run from the sixth murderer or the intimate companion (delight and lust—nandi-rāga). The latent craving (ānusaya-taṇhā) or nandi-rāga is stuck with the mind in the whole round of existence (saṁsāra). So every mind arises already there. When the mind falls into bhavaṅga for the 3rd time, the “pleasure and lust” (nandirāga) mind ceases with the active cognitive mind process. After coming out from the clear bhavaṅga, it is free from the 6th murderer of intimate companion and arrives at the safety place.


The abandonment of defilement at the 3rd stage of samādhi

| (1) Worldly sensual conceptual objects cease.
| (2) the minds taking the worldly conceptual objects cease.
| (3) 1,500 defilement (kilesas) are ceased.
| 

The following objects are able to contemplate or discern with the 3rd bhavaṅga samādhi:

(1) If one of the six senses of object contacts to the clear element of bhavaṅga at the present moment, this samādhi mind is able to contemplate the corresponding mind object (e.g., sight, sound, etc.)—dhamma-ārammaṇa with its ahetuka viññāṇa (i.e., mind and form with no roots). This is the internal arising element.

(2) able to contemplate the two elements of knowing nature and unknowing nature of the clear bhavaṅga. These are internal base elements.

(3) able to contemplate the mind and form arising at the five sense-doors at the present moment, as an example, when a sight object contacts with the eye element (cakkhu-pasāda) the arising form object (rūpārammaṇa) and eye consciousness (cakkhu viññāṇa) This is internal base elements (eye clear element to body clear element).

(4) able to contemplate the five kinds of contact which like an electric current toward the clear bhavaṅga from the clear elements (i.e., cakkhu-pasāda, sota-pasāda, etc.) of the five sense-doors. These are internal contact elements.

(5) every time one of the five contacts (phassa) hits the clear bhavaṅga at the clear bhavaṅga mind and form arise that is the same kind as mind and form which appear there (e.g., a visual object appears at the eye door and the same object also appears at the mind door). The samādhi mind is able to contemplate similar minds and forms that appear at the door of the mind. This is an internal arising element.

(6) able to contemplate the mind contacts (mano-samphassa) which incline back to the corresponding pasāda (e.g., eye clear element) after the mind and form appear at the mind door (mano-dvāra). This is the internal contact element.

(7) every time after a mind contact arises an experience of feeling (mental feeling) arising at sahetu viññāṇa. This samādhi is able to discern or contemplate it. This is an internal arising element. The following sahetu viññāṇa contemplates the preceding sahetu viññāṇa (i.e., mind contemplates a mind).

(8) with this samādhi able to contemplate the above-mentioned mind and form natural process as mind and form, as contact (phassa), as feeling (vedanā) with perceptions (saññā) or contemplate as anicca, dukkha, anatta, etc. with perceptions.

(9) able to discern the particles of 32 parts of the body which appear at the bhavaṅga as dhamma-ārammaṇa of form.

(10) able to give the perceptions of man, woman, tree, etc. to the form objects
which arise or appear at bhavaṅga, if don't want to give the perceptions
also possible.

(11) During the practice (i.e. mahā-vipassanā), the mental states concerning, boredom, distraction, etc. do not arise by themselves as far as the span of time is concerned.

(12) The benefits of this samādhi are:

A yogi can contemplate the above conditioned mind and forms (saṅkhata nāma-rūpa), their variations (vikāra), their characteristics (lakkhaṇa) and conceptual nature in any posture and at any time (such as driving a car, eating, talking, doing, etc.) according to his or her desire.
 
In the beginning, the yogi had the desire to see the paramatā mind and form the objects of contemplation that searching and practising for it. Now he is discerning them, so the matter of finding them is over. Now he only needs to contemplate and develop them with the three universal characteristics until taṇhā, māna and diṭṭhi are rooted out from the mind (the anusayas).

[Here we can see the importance of samma-samādhi—upekkhā ekaggatā samādhi or the 4th jhāna. Also, it is the most difficult part of the practice as mentioned by Ajahn Lee with the analogy of building a bridge across a river. Samādhi was like the middle part of the bridge. A very well-known Burmese teacher said as follows (It may be Soon Loon Sayadaw). It's more difficult to make something not exist before than with something already existing. The first referred to samādhi and the 2nd way insight (the three lakkhaṇas)].

If the yogic with this samādhi does not pay attention to the paramatā objects and instead takes the objects of worldly sensual conceptual objects, he will see, hear, smell, etc. the same as ordinary people.

The above purity of mind (3rd Samādhi) is according to the Snakes Discourse :
(1) free from the dangers of four viper snakes, (2) the five murderers, (3) the sixth murderer or the intimate friend and the yogi finds out the village with six houses and the six bandits [i.e., the six clear elements of eye, ear, etc. and the six sense objects of sight, sound etc. with the six consciousnesses (viññāṇa)]. With the connection of the Six Sets of Six Discourse continue with insight practice the yogi discerns the six clear elements (pasāda), the six sense objects, the six consciousnesses, the six contacts the six feelings and the six cravings (taṇhā). Now the yogi is at the place of crossing the river to the other shore of Nibbāna. To reach the one fourth of the river, i.e., to give up diṭṭhi-ānusaya (the potential defilement of the ego view), he must develop the insights from purification of views (diṭṭhi-visuddhi) to purification by knowledge and vision (ñanadassana-visuddhi).

Analysis of the three stages of purification of the mind.

Three stages of bhavaṅga and its views
U Candima gives the following example for the three stages of bhavaṅga and its views.

A house has three doors inside a compound. These are: the main compound door, the entrance door into the house, and a door into a sleeping room. When the house owner is inside the bedroom he can only see the things inside it, but he cannot see the things in the main room, in the compound and all the external things outside the compound.

If the owner wants to come out from the bedroom, he has to open the bedroom door, and close it again. Outside the room, he cannot see the things inside the bedroom. He can only see the things in the main room. He also cannot see the things in the compound and outside the compound.

From the main room, if he wants to go outside the compound, he has to close the main room door and go out and close it again. Then he'll see only the things in the compound, but not the things in the bedroom, in the main room and outside of the compound.

From the compound, if he wants to go outside, he has to open the compound door and close it back. Outside the compound he only sees the things there, but he'll not see the things in the compound, in the main room and in the bedroom.

If the owner wants to go back to his bedroom from outside, he has to do it in the reverse order as mentioned above.

We can compare the above experiences of the house owner with the yogi's experiences with his attainments of the three stages of purified mind or three bhavaṅga samādhis

1. the 3rd time yogi falls into bhavaṅga is like closing the bedroom door. The doors here are in restricting the boundaries, going in and coming out. The things inside the bedroom are similar to the paramatā objects of mind and form mentioned in the Six Sets of Six Discourse (Chachakka Sutta).

2. the 2nd time the mind falls into bhavaṅga (the cessation of sensual perceptions of mind—kāma saññā of the mind) is like closing the main room door. The things inside the main room are similar to the groups of particles discerned by the yogi.

3. The first time the mind falls into bhavaṅga is like closing the compound door. The things inside the compound are similar to the phenomena there and in accordance with the attentions (manasikāras) of them [(1) 32 parts of the body; (2) the four great elements, (3) the affliction of form (rūpa), mind contact (mano-samphassa) and feeling (vedanā).] The things outside the compound are like all the objects of the external world. The mind takes them as worldly sensual conceptual objects.

4. The house owner is like the yogi's contemplative mind (sahetu mano-viññāṇa, mind consciousness with roots—here is wholesome root).

If we observe and analyse the above comparison, the objects of mind and form are not easily seen and contemplated according to our own desires. In accordance with the different levels or stages of samādhi or bhavaṅga; and the mind and form are also quite different. The contemplative knowledges (ñāṇas) which contemplate the paramatā mind and form are also different according to their purity. A yogi who had attained the 3rd level of samādhi or bhavaṅga will not see or discern the different kinds of paramatā mind and form if he does not enter into the three levels of bhavaṅga and in normal way. It was like the house owner stayed outside the compound.

Note: In the following, Sayadaw U Candima has published his comments in the book.

Whoever is looking for dhamma by using whichever method or system, the dhamma phenomena of six clear elements (pasāda) in them are also the same. The six sense objects falling on the six clear elements are also the same. The six consciousnesses are also the same in them. The six contacts (phassa), the six feelings (vedanā), and the six cravings (taṇhā) are also the same in them. Therefore, the discernment of mind and form also should be the same.

It should not be that the yogis’ discernment are different like this or like that. Paramatā mind and form are clean or purified objects (not defiled). The samādhi which discerns them is also purified samādhi. These minds and forms are penetrated by oneself. In insight (vipassanā) there is no such thing as coolness, clearness like a mirage, with light, floating around, don't know anything and attaining of insight knowledges by the confirmation of a teacher, etc. Yogis have to be careful about these things (It seems to me these are some yogis’ experiences in other methods or systems. I don't know what any of this really means. But there will be some yogis who talk about their experiences in many different ways, some of which may be misunderstood or misleading.)

Three types of bhavaṅga three enemies and three coverings of concepts
I have explained the three bhavaṅga and its views with the example of the owner and the house. I'll base on this example again to explain the abandoning of the hindrance on the process to these bhavaṅgas.

Let us assume the owner had the most expensive ruby kept in the bedroom. The owner employed three security guards to protect his house. The first guard took his place outside the compound main door, the 2nd one was inside the compound to protect the main entrance door into the house, the 3rd one was inside the house at the outside bedroom door.

A notorious bandit wanted to own the ruby. So at first he had to kill the guard outside the compound, he opened the main compound door and closed it again. He had to kill the 2nd guard at the main house entrance door, he opened its door and closed it again. In the house, he had to kill the 3rd guard at the bedroom door, which he opened and closed again. The fourth time he had to kill the owner who was clinging to the ruby.

In the above example, the analogy is as follows.

(1) The guard outside the compound was like a worldly sensual concept with different objects and the poison of the four vipers.

| (2) The guard inside the compound was like the five hindrances.
| (3) The guard inside the house was like delight and lust (nandirāga).
| 

(4) The owner inside the bedroom was like a latent defilement of ignorance (avijjā-ānusaya). The bandit was like the contemplative mind of the eightfold path. 

The analogies of the above-mentioned situations are:

To kill the first guard outside the compound was like before falling into the first bhavaṅga abandoning the defilement which disturb the contemplating mind. Opening the compound door was like falling into the first bhavaṅga.
 
To kill the 2nd guard inside the compound was like abandoning the defilement which disturb the contemplating mind and opening the main house door was like falling into the 2nd bhavaṅga.

To kill the 3rd guard inside the house was like abandoning the defilement which disturb the contemplating mind and opening the bedroom door was like into the 3rd bhavaṅga. Killing the house owner was like coming out from the bhavaṅga, and owning the ruby was like discerning the 36 objects of mind and form (i.e., six sets of six objects mentioned in the Chachakka Sutta).

The paramatā mind and form (rūpa) are the objects of insight knowledge, it's very refined and subtle, arising and passing away very quickly. If the contemplative mind is covered with delusion (moha), clinging to the concepts as reality, the mind is coarse with lobha and dosa, no stability on the present object with dispersion, etc., it cannot discern the 36 kinds of paramatā mind and form. Even though we are talking about mind and form, there are great differences between the appearance of mind and form and the seeing or discerning of mind and form (it can be said as thought or speculation and direct seeing or discerning). Yogis must take care about this point (Sayadaw's point is without right samādhi or the 4th level or the 3rd bhavaṅga samādhi). It is right if the yogi can contemplate and discern the paramatā mind and form arising in the present moment through the object of contact in a second.

The practice of samatha-yānika way to arrive at the right samādhi (samma-samādhi) or the purification of the mind exists as only one way and vipassanā-yānika way also only one way. In his book (i.e., U Candima's “The Way to Stream Entry”), no.(1) Basic ānāpāna kammaṭṭhāna is abandoned craving (taṇhā) for temporary (tadaṅga pahāna). (see the list of the first level of the purification of the mind). Ānāpāna scales like samādhi practice abandoning of taṇhā directly, instead in competition with taṇhā to control the mind to abandon lobha, dosa, moha for temporary (tadaṅga) and longer period (vikkhambhana). 

[In his center, U Candima did not teach his students for realization with this system, but he taught them only how to develop this Samādhi. Then in the future if they like it and can use it. The-inn Gu Sayadaw used this samādhi for insight. In my opinion, it is simpler than using U Candidma’s system of practice.

No.(4), no.(5) and no.(6) practices are to contemplate on taṇhā directly and abandon taṇhā completely (samucceda-pahāna). This taṇhā connects with diṭṭhi and dosa to the mind (the usage here abandon taṇhā completely not with paññā, only with samādhi). 

The first stage of purification of the mind ends here. The active mind process of taṇhā and domanassa is calmed down that for the first time the tension at the bhavaṅga also calmed down.

The second stage of purification of the mind is practising by making sati stable at the cessation of many mental states of the mind, these are taking the objects of past, present and future, mind with hindrances, the mind gives the perceptions on objects with many kinds of concepts, greedy mind on objects, mind with uncertainty of delusion (moha). This is stabilizing of sati at the cessation of all these mental states. The second time with the cessation of unwholesome active mind process that the tension of bhavaṅga calms down for the 2nd time. With the cessation of the above defilement, the mind temporarily calms down and over a period of time it becomes purified.

The practice of the 3rd stage of purification of the mind is that the refined and subtle of the above defilement (i.e., at the 2nd stage) are a bit insecure. When they are arising again practising by making sati totally stable and controlling them, that sati becomes a faculty (satindriya). When mindfulness becomes satindriya the above-mentioned defilement with the refined active mind process are ceased that the refined bhavaṅga calmed down again. In the mind the hindrances of lobha, dosa and moha, and all the minds give the perceptions of concept are purified, and then the mind completed in purity. The mind becomes the faculty of samādhi, in other way a mind completed with right samādhi (samma-samādhi).

With this purified mind, yogi can discern or contemplate the clean paramatā mind and form. And then he can continue with the insight contemplation 

Note: Sayadaw U Candima wrote five chapters on the whole practice of stream entry in his book—"the Way to Stream Entry". It's quite a detailed exposition.

The five chapters are:.

(1) Chapter one: The Nature of Objects of Mind and Form

(2) Chapter two: The Nature of the Practice.
 
(3) Chapter three: Developing the Practice.

 	It's about sīla and samādhi practice. With the seven purifications—it includes the virtue and purification of the mind (sīla and citta-visuddhis).
 
(4) Chapter four: The Nature of the Contemplative Knowledge (ñāṇa)

 In this chapter, he explained about the other four purifications of views, overcoming doubt, purification of the path and not-path and purification of the way. This chapter is on insight practice—mahā-vipassanā.

(5) Chapter five: the Nature of the Noble Path (Magga)

It's about purification through knowledge and vision. This is the 7th purification of the mind. 

In my book, I have no plan to describe Sayadaw U Candima's whole practice. His book was already translated and whoever is interested in it can find it on the internet, www.amazon.com. I will continue to describe the insight practice very roughly. This is related to Chapter Four.

Chapter Four: The Nature of the Contemplative Knowledge

Entering into right samādhi (sammā-samādhi)

After attaining the 3rd bhavaṅga samādhi, yogi prepares for his sitting posture. To arrive back to one's attainment of samādhi, with mindfulness (sati) taking the object of the cessation of mind with worldly concept. At that time, the active mind process which takes the object of external world (loka) temporary ceases (tadaṅga). Because of the active mind process, the tension of the bhavaṅga calms down (This is the first bhavaṅga samādhi). With the calming down of the bhavaṅga, the physical body (kara-ja khandha) and the mind connection are cutting off. The active mind process of connection with taking care of the body also stops at the same time. Even though the four elements are afflicted, the yogi's mind has no suffering.

The body in sitting also has no movement. The physical body is like a stone statue and has stability even for a 10 hours long period. (U Candima takes this samādhi equal to the first rūpa jhāna. In the West, some teachers had a different view on this point and confused people.)

Let sati stay continuously with the cessation of all the minds, and then for the 2nd time the bhavaṅga calm down again. Because of the samādhi, the mind doesn’t want to sit longer period; the mind with lethargy; the mind does not want to stay quiet with thinking this and that; the mind wants to move freely with wrong attention; the mind with sleepy condition, etc.; all these unwholesome active minds with the tension of the bhavaṅga are calmed down. After the 2nd time, the bhavaṅga falls in the mind with sati stays put (??) and without any movement. 

At that time, if the yogi is looking at his own physical body (kara-ja khandha) with ñāṇa (knowledge), he does not know its shape and form, because the 2nd samādhi kept away the concepts. In other way, it's taking the object of cessation that no arising of the worldly minds (lokiya cittas).

With sati continuing stays at the cessation again it abandons the refined active mind process, because of it the tension of the bhavaṅga calms down again. This mind is staying by itself at the clear element (pasāda) of the bhavaṅga mind. There is no movement of the mind with its sati, because the mind with the mental factor of darkness (moha) is cut off from the mind. After it falls into third bhavaṅga, it becomes right samādhi (samma-samādhi). It's completed with samādhi-indriya. It frees from abhijjhā, domanassa and moha with stability. Giving the names of concepts to the six sense objects also cease in stability. It's transcending the worldly concepts and penetrating the mind element (mano-dhātu) of lokiya-paramatā dhamma 

When yogi arrive at this samādhi, all the refined level of active mind process is ceased and calmed down, and his closed eyes open themselves a little. His eye-lashes are also not moving at all with the opened eyes. 

In the following, I will only describe the insight practice very roughly. 

[Diṭṭhi-visuddhi—Specially purified view—Discernment of mind and matter]
Contemplation of mind and matter in the Six Sets of Six Discourse
Let's assume Mr. Brown is the yogi, and he has a son named John. When Mr. Brown is in the 3rd bhavaṅga samādhi, John stands in front of him. When he looks up at John who is standing in front of him, and he cannot incline the mind toward him. Mr. Brown can only take the object on the clear element of the eyes. Previously, he thought that every time he saw any external object, the mind would go out and find that object. That the mind takes an external object and sees it is a wrong view.

The external object contacts the clear eye element and the mind takes the internal object at the clear eye element with seeing and knowing is the right view. With the right seeing by contemplating the clear eye element is not me, not him, there is no life with the soul and the creator. It's expressing the nature of sight object which falls on it. It cannot prevent the clear eye element from receiving the sight object. Here, the object of contemplation is the clear eye element; the contemplative knowledge is the following path factors of mind. (This is discerning of form or matter and mindfulness of the body—rūpa-pariggaha ñāṇa and kāyanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna)

During the contemplation of form or sight object with their nature of characteristic (sabhāva lakkhaṇa) another thing find out is nearly the same as sight object but different seeing nature of a mind. Here, the object of contemplation is the preceding eye consciousness; the contemplative knowledge is the following path factors mind consciousness with roots—sa-hetuka viññāṇa maggan. This is mindfulness of the mind—cittanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna. This seeing mind consciousness is not taking the external object of John, but only taking the object at the clear eye element by itself. These seeing mind consciousness and the form object are nearly the same but have different qualities, one is knowing nature and the other is not knowing nature (i.e., mind and form). 

This mind consciousness does not have the nature of me, no nature of “I see it”, there is no naming of John—my son, no criticism of good or bad, not seeing as a soul, not seeing with clinging as a person or a being, just existing as knowing. Before taking the seeing consciousness as my mind and I see it. Now Mr. Brown knows that the seeing mind is doing its own task. Mr. Brown's wrong view is falling away at the moment of contemplation by seeing it. This is the discernment of the mind and mindfulness of the mind (nāma-pariggaha ñāṇa and cittanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna).

Mr. Brown contemplates nature of elements of mind and form analytically as not me with not-self or non-self insight knowledge. This is discernment of mind and form (nāma-pariggaha ñāṇa). During his contemplation of form at the eye door and its seeing mind, he finds out another significant nature. This nature that arose from the eye door was like an electric current element, i.e., eye contacts (cakkhu-samphassa). When he is carefully observing it, that is running toward the bhavaṅga clear element, and hitting at it. There is no creator or master at this nature, no existence of person and being and no expression of a soul which Mr. Brown Sees it clearly with discernment. The preceding object is eye contacts (cakkhu samphassa), the following contemplating knowledge is the path factors mind consciousness with roots (sahetu viññāṇa magginga). This is nāma-pariggaha ñāṇa and cittanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna).

Continuing the contemplation, Mr. Brown finds out a mental image (picture), appears at the bhavaṅga clear element. This mental image is the same as John outside, and the same image as on the eye clear element. (three of them are the same). The object of contemplation is mind object (dhamma-ārammaṇa), the following contemplating knowledge is the path factors mind of mind consciousness with roots (sahetu viññāṇa magganga). This is discernment of mind abject (rūpa pariggaha ñāṇa) and mindfulness of dhamma (dhammānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna).

Again Mr. Brown observes and investigates, mind object (dhammarūpa) and he finds out another mind element even though it's similar to the dhamma form, but it has the knowing nature of mind consciousness with no roots (ahetuka viññāṇa), because dhamma form has the nature of not knowing anything. This mind element is not giving the concepts of name to that dhamma object (dhamma-ārammaṇa), there is no like or dislike, not making any decision, not doing any wholesome or unwholesome actions, there is no making of with see it or changing with the self to it, it only has the nature of knowing (not more than that). This mind consciousness without roots accepts the mind object only with knowingness. Mr. Brown discerns it with direct knowledge. The object of contemplation is the preceding mind consciousness without roots, the contemplating mind is the following path factors mind consciousness with roots. This is discernment of mind and mindfulness of the mind.

During the observation with contemplation of mind and form at the bhavaṅga; from bhavaṅga to the eye door an element (mind contacts—mano-samphassa) comes out and inclining toward the eye clear element like a lighting. This contemplation is not taking the objects of the eye door and mind door, only contemplating the connection of these two doors. This element, like an electric current, is very quickly arising and passing away. When carefully observe this nature, they are arising in turn like a lightening of two elements from eye to (i.e., from the eye to bhavaṅga and from bhavaṅga to the eye). These are cakkhu-samphassa with mano-samphassa.

The nature of these elements is not me and also not myself (atta), not arisen by my order. No creator exists, no soul exists, etc. This is nāma-pariggaha ñāṇa and cittanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna. 

Whenever these two elements arose, Mr. Brown carefully observed and contemplated the connection between them. This is observing and investigating with a very refined, subtle, penetrative samādhi. Every time these electric currents fall on to bhavaṅga and there is an element (i.e., vedanā) arising which experiences the object with them together (i.e., eye and mind contacts). This aggregate of feeling nature is not me nor my self (atta); not arisen by my order; there is no creator and soul. This is discernment of the mind, and mindfulness of feeling with mind consciousnesses have no roots and roots. (??) These are ahetuka viññāṇa and sa-hetuka viññāṇa—referred to cakkhu-samphassa and mano-samphassa.

Contemplate on the Contemplative Knowledge.
After the contemplation of the objects of mind and form and discerning them as not a person, nor a being and not me, Mr. Brown wants to know about the contemplative knowledge.

Therefore, he takes the object at the eye-door and at the same time the contemplative knowledge arises to contemplate them as the nature of mind and form. Again, he contemplates the preceding contemplative knowledge with the following contemplative k. At the moment, the preceding mind ceases. Here the object is the preceding mind consciousness with roots, the contemplative k. is path factors mind consciousness with roots This contemplative mind with knowledge of concept (vijjā-māna paññatti) arises is not my creation, but arises by itself. This knowledge of mind is not me, nor my self, and not a person nor a being.

And then he contemplates the feeling which arises with the preceding mind k. With the following contemplative mind k., He discerns its rise and fall. With changing of the objects and minds are also changing, 

[Note: Here I don't want to continue the following contemplation with experiments. Now the readers have the general idea of the insight practice.]

Contemplation of the mind with the attention on the worldly sensual concepts
Based on the above-mentioned mind and form process, Mr. Brown takes the object of mind and form appearing at the clear element of bhavaṅga, and he pays attention to it, With the worldly sensual concept (avijjā māna-paññatti, such as “this is John, my son” Then it changes into the mind clinging with a person and a being of defilement by itself. These mind consciousness with roots arise based on the worldly sensual concept by giving the perception (saññā) because they arise from the fetters of defilement taṇhā, māna and diṭṭhi which are not abandoning yet.

Experience (feeling of) this dhamma object also arises with it. Based on this feeling with wrong view as my son and clinging with taṇhā—affection infiltrate the mind (vedanā conditions taṇhā). From taṇhā clinging arises (taṇhā paccaya upādāna). This clinging (upādāna dhamma) does not exist at the present moment because of clinging to the past mind object of John, which appeared at Mr. Brown’s bhavaṅga. Mind object of John with the mind group of mind consciousness with no roots is becoming (bhava), this is a clinging conditioning action for becoming.

The following mind consciousness with roots arising together with clinging is birth (jāti)—bhava paccaya jāti. This becoming of birth (bhava-jāti) is discerned by the following contemplative mind with roots. Here the dhamma object is form dhamma, the following mind with no roots and with roots (i.e., ahetuka and sa-hetuka cittas) know the dhamma object is mind dhamma. 

(The readers should read these two paragraphs carefully from the above until now. These are the arising of the clinging five khandhas by concept. U Candima shows them with dependent co-arise. The whole process is simple, but his expression is complex.) 

Mr. Brown contemplates the preceding mind with mind object and vedanā, and the mind with kilesa are ceased. Here the dhamma object is form, the experience (feeling) of the dhamma object is mind. This is discernment of mind and matter (nāma-rūpa pariggaha ñāṇa). 

In this way, at present life, there are many mind processes of clinging with becoming, birth (upādāna, bhava, jāti) arise. [Here also I will not continue the following dhamma experiments of U Candima. The readers now have the general idea about this section.]

Eye clear element, sight (object), eye-consciousness, mind object (dhamma-ārammaṇa), mind consciousness (mano-viññāṇa), feeling, eye contacts (cakkhu-samphassas and mind contacts (mano-samphassa), and then conceptual object with mind consciousness with roots are the five khandhas (mind and form) of 36 kinds mentioned in the Six Sets of Six Discourse. Here Mr. Brown can contemplate them and discerns the five khandhas which are mentioned there. According to the Vipers Discours this is seeing the six villages, six houses and six bandits. And according to the Ant Hill Discourse is seeing the tortoise.

Contemplation on the mind (dhamma-ārammaṇa) of the skeleton
Based on the above-mentioned form and mind process, Mr. Brown makes the attention to the dhamma object of John appears at the bhavaṅga as a skeleton body. Because of this contemplative mind, the original image of John ceases and a new image of its skeleton arises. If the mind changes, the attention of the object and the dhamma object also changes. Mr. Brown knows this nature with his knowledge (ñāṇa) (rūpa pariggaha ñāṇa; dhammānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna). Again he contemplates with the following mind to this mind object with its concept as a skeleton, and it passes away. (the preceding mind anicca and the following mind maggaṅga; nāma pariggaha ñāṇa and cittanupassanā). This skeleton conceptual mind is not my creation, not me nor self (atta) and it arises by itself and passes away by itself (Mr. Brown contemplates in this way). Again he contemplates the feeling of the preceding mind with the object of the skeleton. The essence of this feeling is that there are no good and bad nature (i.e., not as desirable and undesirable-iṭṭharamana and aniṭṭha ārammaṇa), but only as mere sensations (nāma pariggaha ñāṇa, vedanā satipaṭṭhāna).

Mr. Brown is reflecting in the following way on the form object of the mind (rūpa-dhamma-ārammaṇa) which similar to John at the bhavaṅga element. The mind can never directly relate to external objects. The mind is imprisoned inside the bhavaṅga, the jail room which exists in the four elements of prison with the five doors (Here the mind = prisoner, bhavaṅga = jail room, the physical body= prison, the five prison doors = the five sense-doors). When the five sense objects enter the prison doors (friends or relatives), the five conscious guardians (warders) are receiving them, and the contact jailers bring them to the prisoners of the mind.

Mr. Brown discerns it that way. Before that he thought as the mind was inclining toward the external objects directly and dealing with them. This was wrong believing. With the following contemplative ñāṇa (i.e., sahetu mano-viññāṇa) he discerns the cessation of taṇhā, māna, diṭṭhi minds by itself which is based on the mind knowledge on the skeleton (these minds are with the concepts of my son, John, clinging, person, being, etc.). This knowledge is nāma-pariggaha ñāṇa with cittanupasana satipaṭṭhāna (vīta-raga, vīta-dosa, vīta-moha cittanti pajanati)— it means the mind is without passion, without aversion, without delusion, he discerns them.

Contemplate from the skeleton to particle object
Mr. Brown takes the skeleton object at the bhavaṅga and changes the skeleton to the particles group of object by changing its attention as particles, because bone are not existed as a lump only as a group of particles. At the time, the skeleton image of the bhavaṅga changes into a group of particles, i.e., becoming (bhava). (rūpa-pariggaha ñāṇa, dhammānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna) 

[Here, we must pay attention to the point that the skeleton cannot become a particle without disappearing. It disappears first, and in its place a new object arises. It is not something that can be taken as a soul, as some Mahāyanists think; that is just a change of veneer (or outer appearances).] 

Based in this group of particles dhamma object and Mr. Brown's sahetu viññāṇa which knows this object arises, i.e., birth (jāti). [Here the readers can be confused without the abhidhamma knowledge.] This preceding mind arises and the following mind sahetu viññāṇa discerns it. (cittanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna). When contemplate like this, the mind knowing as the particles ceases (i.e., death—maraṇa). Here also discerning of the vedanā which experiences the object of particles with the preceding knowing mind.

If Mr. Brown abandons the attention of the mind object (dhamma-ārammaṇa) at the bhavaṅga as skeleton or particles or John, then all the mind objects and all the other minds based on these objects are ceased; and then the following mind—sahetu viññāṇa stops at bhavaṅga with just seeing. The following contemplative mind—sahetu viññāṇa discerns these natures (the preceding mind object with the mind dhamma is anicca; the following mind is magga / nāma-rūpa pariggaha ñāṇa; dhammānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna) During at this stage of samādhi, if John was not outside form dhamma object (rūpa-dhamma-ārammaṇa) appears at the bhavaṅga will cease and leaving only with bhavaṅga clear element, and the contemplative mind continues to stay at the bhavaṅga. Even though an outside object exists, if the mind not pay attention to it, the mind still can stay with the bhavaṅga.

Contemplate the past mind objects

After Mr. Brown contemplated the mind-body processes of John which appeared at the bhavaṅga clear element, he based on this mind object of John changes into the childhood of John by paying attention to its past image which he remembers. Then the present image of John appears at the bhavaṅga disappears and the child-hood of John image appears at its place (dhammānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna).

The knowing of changing mind also appears together by itself, vedanā which experiences it also appears with them by itself. Based on the object of this mind and Vedanā in that mind, clinging to the little boy John as a son (clinging view—diṭṭhi-upādāna), my son (clinging to being—atta-vādupādāna) and affectionate mind (kāmupādāna), and other clinging dhammas then appear in his mind (feeling is the condition of craving and clinging OR "feeling" as a result of "craving" and "clinging"). At the present it does not exist but clinging to the past object that mind object appears at the bhavaṅga (clinging conditions becoming—bhava) 

[Note: Here we know the importance of abhidhamma teaching. It makes more clear and profound how the mind with mental states work by conditioning].

The following contemplative mind (sahetu mano-viññāṇa) discerns the arising mind (bhava conditions jāti—birth) with clinging (dhamma object is form dhamma, the preceding minds of ahetuka and sahetu are nāma-dhammas.)

This contemplative mind also discerns the feeling which experiences the object with the preceding mind (dhamma-ārammaṇa is form dhamma, feeling the object is mind dhamma; nāma-rūpa pariggaha ñāṇa). The above mind with kilesa comes to cessation by contemplating the feeling (i.e., jāra and maraṇa).

[In the following U Candima continues with his experiments with contemplation as mentioned above like the others. I will not continue it because readers have the general idea.]

Contemplation on the future mind objects

Let us assume Mr. Brown wants to become a monk in the future. He pays attention to the bhavaṅga and thinks about himself as a monk image, at the moment his image of a monk appears there. (upādāna → bhava). At the same time, the mind knows the object also arises with it (bhava → jāti). And then Mr. Brown’s gladden mind arises on the mind object (monk image). It connects to taṇhā (vedanā → taṇhā). He contemplates this mind with its vedanā, and the gladden mind ceases. He discerns this cessation of the following contemplative mind (i.e., from vedanā and taṇhā stops).

Mr. Brown continues the contemplation with the skeleton mind object of the future and the particles object of the future. All these contemplations are already mentioned before with the present and past objects (please see them).

In these ways he contemplates many times the natural characteristics of mind and form dhammas by changing the mind objects differently (these are dhammānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna). The following knowledge arises in him. Before the practice he was thinking and planning with the past and future mind objects and took them as really exist, but it was not true. In reality because of one's clinging that the clinging objects which were the fake images arose at the bhavaṅga. It only exists at the time of clinging to them, and when the clinging cease they disappeared.

They are unstable, with no essence and not really exist like a romantic art. He discerns them with knowledge (ñāṇa). These obsessions are tormenting and oppressing the clinging mind. A man who makes his own fire is only burning himself, and does no good, but only brings bad results. Mr. Brown becomes fearful and wearisome to the clinging phenomena.

Note: From here onward, I will explain U Candima's instruction on vipassanā practice only in gist.

He continues to explain the contemplation on sound, smell, taste and body touch which are related to the past and future mind and form processes. The way of contemplation is already mentioned as above. 

Ordinary people knows that their thinking and mind objects are in the minds, but they do not have the 3rd level of samādhi or purification of mind (vipassanā khaṇika samadh—here he refers it as such, but as in the beginning he already explained that this khaṇika vipassanā samādhi is according to the Visuddhi Magga and other commentaries equal to the jhanic levels. Not an ordinary moment to moment sati (here the 3rd bhavaṅga samādhi is equal to the 4th jhāna.) that cannot know, see and contemplate as really is— i.e., yathābhūta Ñāṇa. 

All these refer to the bhavaṅga clear element, the objects appear at the bhavaṅga clear element, the true nature of mind consciousness with roots (sahetu mano-viññāṇa) and its changes. Therefore, they wrongly know these things as “I see”, “I think”, etc. They do not see the objects appear at the bhavaṅga with wrongly take them as at external or in the past or future.

Note: U Candima's view on true insight
The contemplative knowledge (ñāṇa) of an insight yogi must be able to discern the paramatā objects as mentioned before. It's not by speculation and thought, but analytically seeing and discerning. Only with this kind of ability to discern analytical skills, the inversion or perversion or distortion (vipallāsa dhammas) which latent and covered one's mind will become extinct. In this way, the yogi must be able to discern the contemplating objects of mind and form (paramatā) which are free from raga, dosa and moha and have the nature of rise and fall. These are their true nature as it really is. At the present moment, discerning of the rise and fall of paramatā nāma-rūpa is the true insight knowledges of non-self with inconstancy (i.e., anatta vipassanā and anicca vipassanā ñāṇas). It's also the discernment of the truth of dukkha. He also makes an important point related to the ending of rising and falling. In the present of practice, the ending of rising and falling is the clinging khandhas of sahetu viññāṇa group (yogis should not mistake the resultant khandhas of present life).

The contemplative mind is able to discern the paramatā objects of the main cause is right samādhi or the purity of mind. Before the mind not arriving yet at this level of purity and contemplating with thinking and speculation as true insight is wrong. The profound and difficult practice of insight becomes easily attainable in a short time. This is the sign of the degeneration or decline of paṭipatti-sāsana. (This is not only in Burma, but also in the West. See Buddhism in the West.)

The existence of the three worlds.

After contemplation of the mind objects related to the past and future of the five sense objects (i.e., eye, car, nose...) the following knowledge arises to Mr. Brown. Even though the mind consciousness cannot go out from the mind-door (manodvāra) or except the manodvāra cannot incline toward other doors, it can pay attention to any desire object and clinging object. He can investigate and experience directly the nature of the mind and its characteristics and wondrous nature, that his insight knowledge of non-self nature becomes more clear and able to make his own decision on it. Therefore, he understands that if there is no mind and there will be no world (loka), and if loka exists, it depends on the decision of the mind.

Note: An arahant takes the object of Nibbāna, even though he has the mind not clinging to it as the world (loka). He just stops at seeing, hearing, just stops at knowing, etc. that liberate from the concept of loka. 

After understanding of them Mr. Brown looking at the Sun in the sky and go into the 3rd bhavaṅga samādhi. At the bhavaṅga the mind object of the Sun with the sky appears on it. Mind consciousness with rootless (ahetuka viññāṇa) appears by taking this object. Prior to this experience, he believed that the world of the sky and the sun existed outside, which was wrong. The Sun and the sky appear at the bhavaṅga are form dhamma and it's the physical world (okāsa-loka). Knowing this dhamma object as sky and the Sun, the clinging mental mind world is only staying at the bhavaṅga. This dhamma object of sky and the Sun will not appear if one has no mind. Human beings are taking the world with clinging as external, but in reality it exists at one's own bhavaṅga. This knowing is knowing the existences of the physical world (okāsa-loka) and ahetuka mano-viññāṇa- the world of beings. (satta-loka).

The knowing mind with the concept takes the objects of that world (i.e., mind object and ahetuka mind consciousness) knows it as the Sun and concept is the following arising of the other world (i.e., sahetu mind which is the world of being, the same world as a hetuka mind). With the contemplative mind, contemplates the arising satta loka. These okāsa-loka and satta loka (i.e., mind object and these two knowing minds) are arisen by itself with conditionings. The mind discerns it as one of the worlds, i.e., conditioned world (saṅkhāra-loka). When taking the object at the eye-door, the sky with the Sun of physical object (rūpārammaṇa) also appear there and the mind discerns it. This is okāsa-loka. The eye-consciousness knows this object is satta-loka. These two lokas are arisen by causes and conditions and exist as rising and falling is conditioned world (saṅkhāra-loka). The contemplative ñāṇa knows these three worlds is knowledge of the worlds.

From the above direct experience, Mr. Brown discerns the following dhamma. The eye and mind doors are the places for the existence of the world, only these lokas exist, there is no I-ness exists and not me; also not others; not a person nor a being; not man nor woman; not a place for love and hate and not a place for clinging with fetters. He discerns and understands it that the falling away for the identity view (sakkayadiṭṭhi) becomes more purified Mr. Brown continues with other objects with the contemplation (including family members, etc.) for many times.

The connection between internal and external worlds
From the above experiences, Mr. Brown understands that there are three worlds that exist as mind and form phenomena. (i.e., okāsa, satta and saṅkhāra-lokas, The sunlight colour is form (rūpa) phenomenon and okāsa-loka, and it dispels darkness by conditioning that also saṅkhāra-loka. This loka contacts with the eye clear element of okāsa-loka and eye-consciousness of satta-loka arises.

This satta-loka of eye-consciousness inclining toward the okāsa-loka of form object that it also called saṅkhāra-loka. These three lokas contact together by conditioning that phassa-satta-loka and saṅkhāra-loka arise, which is the result. This phassa-loka changes the physical object-loka at eye clear element-loka into mind object-loka (dhamma-ārammaṇa) by sending it to the bhavaṅga-loka via the nerve system loka.
 
With the contact of the dhamma-object loka of the Sun and the bhavaṅga of satta-loka and the conditioned ahetuka viññāṇa of satta-loka arises. These three lokas are also saṅkhāra-loka and come to contact again. Because of this cause phassa of satta-loka arises and this loka conditions the form (rūpa) object at the eye-door as dhamma object loka and sends it to the bhavaṅga loka for conditioning. For this dhamma object loka of desirable or undesirable experience, it connects to vedanākkhandha of satta-loka. Based on these vedanākkhandha satta-loka and the form dhamma of okāsa-loka objects, with the arising and experience of the sahetu viññāṇa of satta-loka, becoming greedy when happy and painful when unhappy, leads to the mind process of loka existence.

[In this section Sayadaw U Candima gives his view on the true nature of the mind and right or true insight as follows:

The mind is except from the bhavaṅga which is at the hadaya-vatthu (i.e., heart basis) does not go out anywhere. This point is also mentioned by Mogok Sayadawgyi in the wrong view of ordinary people - such as atta or soul, and even some Chinese monks use this way when teaching people the subject of rebirth.  Therefore, the external five sense objects fall on the five sense-doors and arrive at the bhavaṅga. The tastes of desirable and undesirable sense objects also arrive at bhavaṅga. The objects of past and future also rely on the bhavaṅga. With the contact with objects, the bhavaṅga mind consciousness arises. Taṇhā, man, diṭṭhi arise if the mind with unwholesome mental factors. It becomes sīla samādhi, paññā mind if combined with wholesome mental factors. Therefore, all the objects fall on to bhavaṅga only and the mind consciousness can reflect their natures. For insight contemplation, if one's contemplative mind is still taking the external object  for attention or reflection (or) one's body form of concept, then it's still not the right contemplative knowledge.  Because as explained above all the objects on the bhavaṅga and mind consciousness with roots (here contemplative mind) also at the bhavaṅga contemplates the objects with its characteristics. Therefore, if the yogi still does not see the clear element of bhavaṅga, then he still does not see the phenomena of mind (dhammas) or the true Dhamma.

There is a saying by the wise, i.e., “Knowing and seeing two views purify wrong view; seeing the bhavaṅga attain the right way.” The objects of worldly sensual concept and the worldly paramatā objects only appear at the bhavaṅga. The yogis contemplate the appearing objects at the bhavaṅga. In this way, it arrives at purification of view by two knowing and two seeing. Ledi Sayadawgyi wrote in his book with “Uttama-purissa Dīpanī” as follows: "If someone penetrates the bhavaṅga he should know that is an outstanding man." All the dhammas appear at the bhavaṅga and contemplation also at this place. The three worlds also exist at the bhavaṅga and transcending the worlds also at this place. This transcending comes from the cessation of clinging in the mind, which based at this bhavaṅga.

Note on the existence of the internal world
Mr. Brown understands the internal existence of the world as mentioned above. These are at the bhavaṅga clear element the appearance of the image of the dhamma objects (i.e., mind object) of the near past, the appearance of the image of the dhamma objects of the far distant past and the future and at the present time objects. He reflects their nature with the following analogies.

The bhavaṅga clear element is like a white canvas, attention (manasikāra) is like a paint brush, clinging is like paint; a painter with thought (vitakka) thinking about one's desirable object and with his hand like volition (cetanā) draws a picture (one's desirable object) on the canvas and the five khandhas of mind object loka appear on it.

The meaning here is at the bhavaṅga clear element a sight of mind object loka appears if pay attention of a form object (rupārammaṇa) which one had seen before in the past. In the same way, the other objects of sound, smell, taste and touch the mind objects (lokas) of them appear or arise at the bhavaṅga clear element respectively. It's also the same at the present, the five sense objects fall on the five senses of door and arise at the bhavaṅga if paying attention to them, the five sense objects appear at it and become lokas.

Many uncountable Buddhas and arahants (including pacceka-buddhas) were liberated from the three lokas (okāsa, satta and saṅkhāra lokas) of the three internal lokas, which are the causes of the clinging mind. The external three lokas are always existing as the changing processes. Mr. Brown has understood this point. 

The internal sense bases (ajjhatta-āyatanas) are true paramatā and essence of natural phenomena, which are profound and difficult to discern. We cannot know about them by speculation, hearing and studying knowledge (e.g., genesis, evolution etc.). The writer (refers to his present books) did not write about it by imagination, study and hearing. It was like he himself put the most valuable ruby in his hand and discerned it clearly. To be able to know and see it is quite difficult, and he must put his life and body to realize it. Even though he had to write about it and also be aware that it would be rare for someone able to put forth the effort to see them. It’s unable to discern them with ordinary faith and effort. The Buddha himself said this to Prince Bodhi—Bodhirājakumāra Sutta, MN 85, Majjimanikaya (also can be found at MN 26, The Noble Search).

Insight contemplation with the first and second bhavaṅga samādhis
After the contemplation of the mind and body nature with the 3rd Samādhi, Mr. Brown abandons it and goes down to the 2nd samādhi.

He knows the cessation of the bhavaṅga clear element in the 2nd samādhi. There are no worldly sense concepts of the object and paramatā object, and knowing the cessation only with the samādhi. With the following contemplative knowledge of sahetu viññāṇa he knows the preceding samādhi mind of sahetu viññāṇa there. At that time, taking the objects of 36 kinds of paramatā mind and form in the 3rd samādhi are not there any more (or) he does not see it.

Even though making the effort of attention for many times it does not appear, only the attention mind arises once and ceases there. This is like the analogy mentioned before, when the owner of the house comes out of the bedroom and then closes the door, he can no longer see what is inside the bedroom, only what is outside the bedroom. He also does not see the thing inside the house compound and outside of it. The object of cessation is like the object outside the bedroom.

If he comes out from the object of cessation and pays attention to the physical body will discern the refined particles are changing very thickly. These refined particles also like the object outside the bedroom. 

The discernment of particles with the 3rd samādhi are the mind object particles (dhamma-ārammaṇa) which appear at the bhavaṅga clear element. The discernment of the particles with the 2nd samādhi is not this one, it's the paramatā rūpa particles (kalāpas) of the physical body. Mr. Brown contemplates the changing particle because it has no sign of shape or form and exists only as a group of particles. It's changing, not according to my will. At this changing process, I do not exist. This changing form (rūpa) is not my creation. There is no life and soul in these changing particles. It does not have the nature of stability, and only exists as change. It is itself the (nature of ) "conditioning form".

Again, Mr. Brown changes his samādhi into the first bhavaṅga samādhi. At that time, the first level purified mind (contemplative mind) discerns the inclining mind (mano-samphassa) from the mind-door (mano-dvāra) toward the hotness of the form (the afflicted form). Once this inclined mind (mano-samphassa) reaches the most prominent place (i.e. the hottest place), this mind will have a concept (as heat) when the following contemplative mind  investigates it and sees or discerns it with the arising mind as the concept of heat. You cannot change the awareness of the hot mind to the awareness of the cold. The following contemplative mind contemplates the arising hotness of mind of its nature non-self (anatta). The perception of the hotness of mind is not by my creation and not me; he is contemplating with insight. Again with mindfulness he contemplates it as only the nature of form (rūpa) and the preceding mind taking the concept of hotness cease by itself and the mind knowing with paññā of the changing nature of form arises; he investigates them with the three universal characteristics.

Again Mr. Brown contemplates the mano-samphassa which from the bhavaṅga inclining toward the afflicted form (rūpa). This inclining nature does not have life or soul; there is no I-ness exists and not my creation (also not by God or Mahābrahma); there are no instigators (or others). This is the natural characteristics of the mind which inclining toward the afflicted form by itself to connect rūpa with the bhavaṅga; he contemplates it with insight knowledge.

Again, when he contemplates with insight to the following result of the inclining mind he discerns the experience of feeling (vedanā) which feels the undesirable nature of afflicted form at the mind-door (mano-dvāra); this is the feeling nature of experience on the object. This is not my feeling; there is no me in the nature of experience nor life and soul in it; there is no creator, etc. He contemplates the nature of vedanā with insight. 

When contemplating only its nature of vedanā and in one's own mind, there is no pain and pleasure (dukkha and sukha). If not contemplating vedanā as just only feeling nature and let the following mind relates it with self (diṭṭhi) nature and with the undesirable taste of vedanā, then the mind with concepts (hot, tense, pain, etc.) arises for not wanting to experience it (i.e., undesirable or unpleasant objects). The following contemplative mind with the three characteristics of insight contemplates the arising conceptual mind. Again change the contemplation to vedanā as just feeling nature then the original perception of the mind with the hotness and pain, not wanting to feel, all these mental states cease by themselves. This can be discerned with contemplative knowledge.

This is not the kind of abandoning with one's own will or desire, also not the kind of cessation by changing the posture. This is also not the kind of cessation by running away from the object during the arising. It's seeing the characteristic of the mind experience of vedanākkhandha (feeling aggregate) the sakkāya-paramatā dhamma (which means the true existence, not like the self or soul) that the cessation of dosa with domanassa. In other way the discernment of the truth which is the true knowledge (vijjā—ñāṇa) that from feeling (vedanā) and craving (taṇhā) ceases.

With the attainment of right view (sammā-diṭṭhi) there is only the feeling of the mind nature exists, no I-ness exists. With the discernment of it's only the changing nature of form (rūpa) and feeling of the mind nature and the non-self insight knowledge arises. Discernment of these with khandhas is seeing the truth of dukkha.

If contemplate the feeling as me and with feel it which is related with diṭṭhi and taṇhā, and the original concept of hotness with not wanting to feel domanassa mind arises again by itself. This is the mind changing by changing the object of attention taking the object of concept as reality then diṭṭhi and taṇhā mind arises, if contemplate the reality of paramatā dhamma diṭṭhi and taṇhā ceases.

Again, take off the inclining mind contact (mano-samphassa) from the object and return it to the mind-door, then contemplate on the original form element with knowledge and cannot give the perception (saññā) of hotness to the conceptual object. It can be given the perception that it has the quality of paramatā form that is only constantly changing. These are existing as changing form paramatā and the inclinable volitional formation of the mind (saṅkhārakkhandha) which are mind and form. There is no person nor being exists, the non-self insight knowledge arises.

Again, take off the inclinable mind from the original form object of fire element (hotness) and return to the bhavaṅga, and then with one's desire, change the object with another object. Mr. Brown discerns the mind contact (mano-samphassa) from the mind-door, it inclines toward the changing object (new object). It happens by attending to the new object (manasikāra) with the mind, at that time, with knowledge sees the mind contact inclining toward the new object from the bhavaṅga. Again, with one's desire relaxes (i.e., let go off), the attention on the new object and the inclining mind contact ceases by itself, and a new mind contact arises by itself toward the original distinctive heat element of form (tejadhātu). Mr. Brown discerns all of them with knowledge (directly). He is able to do these things like a cat getting a mouse and playing with it—i.e., the arising of the inclinable nature of the mind by itself, controlling the inclining mind and changing the inclination toward a new object with one's desire.

U Candima's view on this point
Experiencing the Dhamma and discerning of the truth of dukkha mean discernment with analytical knowledge on the natural qualities of the paramatā mind and form objects, which is like seeing a priceless ruby in one’s hand. With one’s own thought and speculation, contemplate on feeling (vedanā) as it’s  experiencing or feeling the object. It will only become the insight of appearance (in Burmese athim-vipassanā; athim means appearance). And then the valuable insight dhamma becomes cheap dhamma and an easy-going practice, from cheap value it can fall down to no value. (This warning is important. In the past I had read some English books written by westerners in practice and the title of one of the books is- Lazy Guide to Enlightenment, etc.)

In the following, U Candima continues to explain the contemplation of insight on other mind contacts and feelings (vedanās) from the other doors (dvāras). The readers already have the general idea how to do it, so I will leave here. 

Contemplation on mind contact and feeling with the body movements
Mr. Brown continues his practice on the mind and body process with the body movements as follows: There are body movements of sitting, standing, lifting the feet, stepping, butting down the feet, taking things, giving things, etc, he takes these objects with concepts and intrinsic nature (paramatā) and contemplate its arising mind and matter (form) process with insight knowledge. For example, in the process of stepping on the foot, the only thing to be aware of is the rising of the mind of the desire to step. The following mind should not give the perception of a mind that wants to step out (saññā) (not like the Mahasi system).

The mind contact will incline toward by itself to the heaviness of form (at the feet) which arisen by itself. As soon as after the inclination, the knowledge mind pays attention to the nature of feeling (vedanā) which experiences good or bad. A mind will will arise by itself, with no concept (perception) of heaviness—such as the mind inclines toward the arising form (rūpa) and feels it. If the concept of object is taken, the above-mentioned mind that just knows the nature of paramatā will stop on its own, a mind that arises by giving a heavy name to it, without wanting to feel it. When putting down the foot, the prominent form (rūpa element) arises with the mind by themselves, yogi has to watch and observe them. 

Knowing the paramatā form dhamma is kāyanupassanā satipaṭṭhāna. Discernment of the feeling which experiences the object form is vedanānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna. Contemplation of the mind with vedanā is cittānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna.

Contemplate on the rise and fall of mind and form process according to their cause and effect relationship is dhammānupassanā satipaṭṭhāna. In this way, contemplate to have the clear knowledge on the cause of the arising of ignorance (avijjā) and it's cessation; the cause of the arising of dukkha and its cessation; the cause of the arising and taṇhā, māna and diṭṭhi and their cessation. The following contemplative mind sahetu viññāṇa is seeing penetratively of the mind contact which inclining instantaneously and after the inclination the mind (also sahetu mano-viññāṇa which is the preceding mind) feels the feeling (vedanā) of the desirable or undesirable object (iṭṭha-ārammaṇa and aniṭṭha-ārammaṇa).

At this place, whatever desirable or undesirable object of the feeling (vedanā arises if the contemplative mind only contemplates just as feeling to pain and pleasure and only knowing as feeling. The following contemplative mind also can contemplate and discern the preceding knowing mind.

If the yogi not contemplate just as vedanā but as me and mine with diṭṭhi-taṇhā, and with the base of desirable object of feeling and the pleasant nature of the mind arises by itself. This mind is discerned by the following contemplative mind. If based on the undesirable object of vedanā, an unpleasant mind arises by itself. This arising mind also has to contemplate with the following contemplative mind with insight knowledge by way of three characteristics.

This 1st bhavaṅga or 1st level of purified mind or the contemplative knowledge mind cannot discern the mind and body of the 3rd bhavaṅga and also the mind and body of the 2nd bhavaṅga, it also cannot take these objects. Similarly, the first samādhi cannot take worldly objects of the senses, such as man, woman, my son, my daughter, human being, dog, tree, etc. These sensual conceptual objects are like all the objects outside the house compound (see the analogy of the three bhavaṅga samādhis compare with the 3 doors of the house) 

With the 1st bhavaṅga samādhi, as mentioned above contemplate the mind and form contemplating thoroughly by insight knowledge until all doubts are clear away, and then abandoning it and changing into the 2nd bhavaṅga samādhi. At that time, this 2nd samādhi can’t contemplate and see the four elements, 32 parts of the body objects and worldly sensual objects which the 1st samādhi has discerned, these objects cease. In the same way, it does not see the 36 types of mind and form, which the 3rd Samādhi discerns.

After arriving at the 2nd bhavaṅga it takes the cessation of worldly conceptual objects and worldly paramatā objects with the perception of the mind. Abandoning the cessation (i.e., come out from Samādhi) and paying attention to the physical body, and it discerns the groups of refined particles are falling apart. At that time, the 2nd samādhi cannot contemplate all the external objects of outside the house compound which are like sensual conceptual objects (i.e., ordinary mind) and the objects of inside the house compound which are like the four elements and 32 body parts (i.e., the 1st samādhi). It also cannot see the objects inside the bedroom, which are like 36 kinds of mind and form (i.e., 3rd samādhi). From the 1st bhavaṅga to the 2nd bhavaṅga is like opening the main house door and entering inside the house.

If the yogi not entering into the 1st bhavaṅga and with the ordinary mind cannot know all the objects of mind and form related to the 1st, the 2nd and the 3rd bhavaṅga samādhis respectively. It's like knowing the objects of earth, forest, mountain, etc. and the mind knows them as man, woman, I am hot, I am unbearable, etc. which are non-existence of concepts with taṇhā, mama and diṭṭhi mind. In the same way, if the yogi abandoning all the three bhavaṅgas cannot take the objects of related to them, and he has the mind of like someone who does not practice only has common view and knowledge. At that time, the yogi only with the speculation of knowledge can know the contemplating objects with their minds and the nature of the contemplative mind.

This is the description of the analytical knowing of the paramatā mind and form nāma-rūpa pariggaha ñāṇa by way of purification of view (diṭṭhi-visuddhi).

Note: Afflicted rūpa (form), the inclination of the mind, experience of vedanā—these pair of mind and form can be contemplated at the 1st bhavaṅga and also at the 2nd bhavaṅga. 

Purification by Overcoming Doubt

(paccaya--pariggaha Ñāṇa)

In the purification of view (nāma-rūpa pariggaha ñāṇa) explained about the objects of mind and form which can be contemplated by the levels of bhavaṅga samādhi (i.e., 1st, the 2nd and the 3rd bhavaṅga respectively). Now here U Candima continues to explain the causes of their arising to the mind and form in three levels which is the arising of the discernment of the conditions of mind and form (paccaya-pariggaha ñāṇa). 

After his discernment of the present nature of mind and form, Mr. Brown  knows them with the analytical direct knowledge as these are not mine, not my construction and nor the I-ness exists. If this khandha group is not my construction, then what made it happen? This desire for knowledge arises in him, and he contemplates it with his discerning knowledge of the Buddha's teachings.

In the Chachakka Sutta- the Buddha taught as follows:

"Dependent on the body and tangibles, body consciousness arises, the meeting of the three is contact, with contact as condition there is feeling, with feeling as conditions there is craving."

Based on the four elements is the body clear element (kāya-pasāda). Dependent on contact of body clear element and the tangible object, the result of body consciousness arises. Again dependent on the contact of the 3 (i.e., body consciousness, body clear element and tangible object), the result of the new element body contact (kāya-samphassa) arises. This new arising body contact changes the object into mind element (dhamma-dhātu) by connecting the bhavaṅga and new cause arises. Dependent on this cause, the tangible mind-objects (ahetuka and sa-hetuka) in bhavaṅga result in the arising of mind-consciousness.

Again with this mind-object (dhamma-ārammaṇa), ahetuka-mano-viññāṇa and bhavaṅga dependent on the three contact that the result of mind-contact (mano-samphassa) arises. This cause of mind contact causes the result of feeling which experiences the desirable and undesirable objects arises. If this feeling with the new arising sahetu viññāṇa sticks with moha (delusion), the result of lobha, dosa, diṭṭhi unwholesome dhamma arises. If this rooted mind-consciousness (sahetu viññāṇa) arises along with the path factors (maggaṅgas), it can abandon the corresponding defilement, and lobha, dosa, moha, etc., these defilement will cease.

In this way, Mr. Brown continues to contemplate and reflect on the other sense-doors to understand the causes and effects relationship of mind and form, until overcoming doubt.

Present supporting conditions for the cause of khandha
Here I will not describe U Candima's description on this topic. I will only give a general idea about it. The conditions for the causes are—kamma, citta, utu, āhāra, sense objects, sense doors, dependent co-origination process, etc. (Here Mogok Sayadaw's teaching on this subject is very good for contemplation).

The arising of the mind process and its ending
After contemplation on the present conditions for the arising khandha, Mr. Brown continues to deal with the following questions in his mind.

| 1. Why does this khandha process arise?
| 2. What are the causes for the arising (life) and cessation (death) of new minds in this life?
| 3. At present, every human being supports the body with nutriment (āhāra) but they can't prevent aging, sickness, and death. What are the causes of it?
| 4. Is there any new khandha still arising after this khandha ends, or not arising?
| 5. What are the causes of new khandha arising and not their arising?
| 

Mr. Brown uses the Paṭiccasamuppāda (dependent co-arising) teaching with contemplation to find out the above questions for the answers. The answers for them are as follows:

1. This khandha process is the action (kamma) of a past life process.

2. In this present life, the arising of new mind processes (existence or alive) is the cause of kammic energy, the four elements and the present sense objects. New minds not arising (i.e., death) is the ending of the energy for the round of kamma result (vipāka vaṭṭa) or the life span of the khandha built by kamma.

3. In this present life however we support the khandhas with nutriments, we still cannot stop ageing, sickness, and death (It is like a house that becomes slowly degraded is the ending of the vipāka vaṭṭa energy).

4. Even though this present khandha is over if it still has kamma and new khandha of the next life (future life) will arise again. The khandha house will continue to build new life due to the presence of the kamma.

5. Because of kamma we get the new life of the khandha house.

In this way, overcoming doubt and knowing the causal relationship between the aggregates (khandha) of mind and form is paccaya-pariggaha ñāṇa. The arising of the paccaya-pariggaha ñāṇa in the yogi's mind that clear away doubt on the past khandha, present khandha, future khandha and on the teaching of PAṬICCASAMUPPĀDA.

Purification of the path and not-path

(Sammasana Ñāṇa)

In this section I will not explain what U Candima explains in his book. Here I only give the general idea about them. Yogis have to contemplate the three universal characteristics of anicca, dukkha and anatta for many times. First with the 1st bhavaṅga samādhi with their corresponding objects such as 32 body parts, four elements, etc. And then with the 2nd bhavaṅga and the 3rd bhavaṅga respectively. Contemplations are quite in detail. 

At the end of contemplation with the 3rd samādhi section, he writes:

In this way, with the four postures (lying, sitting, standing and walking) contemplating the basic mind and form (nāma-rūpa) at the six sense-doors. This contemplation of knowledge is the coarser rise and fall knowledge (udayabbaya ñāṇa). When the contemplation and reflective power become powerful and sati power with contemplative knowledge power becomes better or increased. And then the knowledge mind is able to contemplate the objects of mind and form more and more details. Yogi entering the three bhavaṅgas of samādhi back and forth quickly able to discern in details each level of the objects. Even the yogi can discern the collision with form particles with each other. (It is mentioned in one of The-inn Gu Sayadaw's talks that he can hear sounds.) Another experience is from the five sense-doors the inclination of the contact element can be discerned as like electric current with electric particles falling apart, like sparks. In this way, discernment of contemplative knowledge becomes powerful so that it doesn't need special attentive sati, and it's like contemplation and discernment arise automatically.

U Candima continues to explain some experiences of the 10 insight corruptions (vipassanupakkilesas) yogis encounter. I will not explain it because readers can find them in other teachings.

At that time, (with the above experiences) yogi without knowingly cling to these things with thinking as “I attain the path and fruit”. He can abandon his contemplation of paramatā mind and form objects. If yogi has these experiences, he should know that it's still not the supramundane path knowledge. At that time, yogi has to continue with its primary paramatā mind and form objects until insight knowledge becomes purified. This is the insight process of purification of the path and not-path. In most cases, the above experience of insight corruption occurs more often in people who have not learned knowledge (Pariyat).

Purification of the way

Knowledge of rise and fall (the mature stage)

In this section U Candima explains about knowledge of the dissolution of formations (bhavaṅgañāṇa); knowledge of dissolving things as fearful (bhayañanam); knowledge of fearful things as dangerous (ādīnava ñāṇa) and knowledge of disenchantment with all formations (nibbidā ñāṇa); knowledge of desire for deliverance (muñcitukamyatā ñāṇa); knowledge of reflecting contemplation (paṭisaṅkhā ñāṇa); knowledge of equanimity toward formations (saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa).

From the knowledge of equanimity toward path knowledge
Whatever living being maybe, if they have the khandhas and every time the sense objects contact with the sense-doors, the impermanence of mind and form  always exists there even though they can contemplate with insight or not. The nature of their rising and falling conditions will not end. A yogi has faith (saddha) as if he can discern mind and form will arrive at Nibbāna. He has effort (viriya) to discern them, and has mindfulness (sati) to contemplate them without fail. Every time mind and form arise, one can contemplate straight away with samādhi, and with wisdom (paññā) contemplate the nature of mind and form. All these are only worldly objects, and behind these five factors there is a latent element (anusaya) with dissatisfaction. This dissatisfaction has a desire to free from the impermanent mind and form. There is conceit if seeing impermanent mind and form must be able to attain Nibbāna which is the cessation of them. The desire is for the permanent Nibbāna, and what one gets is impermanent. But the mind is unable to stay at a place which is free from mind and form objects.

This happening because there is clinging with desire in the contemplative mind for the cessation of impermanent khandha. This level is the early stage of knowledge of equanimity. From there, when the power of contemplation becomes strong, the knowledge of contemplation is freed from desires, and one can only see them (without reaction) while contemplating. This is the mature stage of the knowledge of equanimity.

Knowledge of conformity (Anuloma-ñāṇa)
This knowledge is still contemplating with equanimity the worldly objects of conditioned mind and form with the three characteristics. Even though it’s contemplating on the impermanence of the mind and form, which are not ending yet. The contemplating knowledge is like stopping the impermanence of a conditioned mind and form with calmness. When contemplating in this way and reflection arises as follows. Mind and form conditioned phenomena are in the processes of arising, presence and dissolution (three sub-moments of duration) after attaining the khandha. If the yogi does not abandon it, he will not free or liberate, but except this object of conditioned worldly dhamma there is no other object to incline on. He also became a little tired from contemplation. Even though becoming tired, he still doesn't know and see Nibbāna yet, also not free from the worldly province. With the desire to be freed by contemplating it but arriving back to the worldly province.
 
From the above reflection and yogi contemplates it every time with the desire to know but not free from the lokiya province. In this way, he reflects and contemplates for many times and makes a strong decision. "I'll not realise Nibbāna" with this decision and put down his concern and abandon all his desires and volition to do it. At that time, the mind wanting to contemplate to know, to free; and the mind wanting to find the cause to be free, how to look for it, etc. and then all these mental formations (citta saṅkhāra) with desire are ceased and fall into bhavaṅga.

(This process is similar to some mentioned in the commentary and teachers,  such as jumping to cross the trench, a sea-bird looking for the shore)

At that time, the minds with all the worldly mental formations are ceased, and it takes the object of Nibbāna which is freed from the shape and image of worldly objects. It stays by itself like it has no owner. This is taking the object of cessation of the worldly mental formations or the object of Nibbāna—the truth of cessation of Dukkha.

This mind is specially purified and able to take the object of Nibbāna because it could abandon both desire of wanting to take the worldly paramatā objects and wanting to realize Nibbāna. At the contemplative knowledge, all the desires are ceased, and it liberated from the bondage of craving (taṇhā).

Here is the ending of Sayadaw U Candima teaching on right samādhi and insight. Readers who want to know more in detail please search for the English translation of his book on the internet www.amazon.com as an ebook.

In the following I want to offer the readers an important simple practice related to kamma (the law of action) and its result which was mentioned in his book:

“The Exposition of the Profound Puzzle of Jonathon Seagull by Richard Bach” 
(“Jonathan Livingston Seagull” written by American author Richard Bach)
The reason for fewer followers in Buddhism and the reason for easy disappearance
The Buddha taught human beings to see the faults of sensual pleasures and to abandon them. But humans like sensual pleasures with strong desire. He taught humans to look after their sīla (precepts), virtues and morality. But they do not want to look after it. The Buddha taught them to purify their minds by practising samādhi. But humans prefer their minds to be suffused with variegated defiled objects. The Buddha taught to contemplate the nature of the khandhas—mind and matter as inconstant, suffering and non-self. But human being clings to them as a person, a being or a soul (self) and sees them as constant (permanent), happy, self and beautiful (subha).

As a result, Buddhists are fewer in numbers than other faiths and Dhamma tends to disappear.

(Sañjaya, the first teacher of Sāriputta, said that there are more fools than wise people, and this is true. The wise will come to Dhamma and the fools to other views).

A simple experiment for one who disbelieves in the law of actions and its results.
Here is an offering to someone (or people) who does not believe in the law of actions and its result, which can be known directly with the following experiment. This practice refers to people who have wrong livelihood such as: killing (to animals), murdering (criminal gang, mafia gang, etc.), etc. They should do this experiment by themselves."

| 1. Spread a thick blanket on the floor.
| 2. Sitting crossed-legs on the floor.
| 3. Put your right hand on the left hand
| 4. Breathe the air in and out more than six or 7 times stronger than normal breathing, so that one can hear loudly with one's ears.
| 
| 5. Breathe the air arriving at the chest
| 6. Breathe with acceleration (not breathing slowly)
| 7. Breathe mindfully (with sati) in and out
| 8. Practise for at least 40 minutes
| 

Practise in this way for around 30 or 40 minutes, one has to suffer as one's own action. As an example, if one had killed pigs, he would suffer like pigs; if killed cows, he would suffer like cows, etc. All these people will know themselves according to their own actions. After gaining an understanding of your behavior, you want to walk away from the exercise, then slowly reduce your inhalation and exhalation. And don't stop it instantly. Don't put effort in the breathing. Abandoning all the objects or views one has been seen (It seems this point is important. No-one should carry around one's own unwholesome actions in the mind—We only need to learn our mistakes and try our best to correct and change them.)

I once saw a Chinese documentary about this issue. One of the scenes showed a middle-aged man killing a donkey by hitting the poor being on the head with a sledgehammer (It's too cruel). There is another scene which shows the same man squatting on the floor with both hands on his head, crying with pain and moving on the floor. Facing this suffering person was the Chinese yogis who were meditating on their seats.

Western evolutionary theory speculates that human beings developed from monkeys. But they don't have a devolutionary theory. The Buddha taught both evolution and devolution but not as theories and as law—The Law of Kamma or Actions which are mental, verbal and physical actions respectively. Of these three, mental law is the most important one and the basic for the others— mental→verbal→ physical actions. The law of kamma is a natural law, not man-made. It never deviates from the truth. Laws and regulations made by man are made by worldlings full of defilement. As a result, it sometimes causes problems, danger, and suffering. (For example, gun laws in the United States; some politicians and political leaders change laws and regulations because of corruption—for their purposes: control of power and wealth.) 

The Buddhist law of karma is related to evolution and degeneration (devolution). The dhamma of evolution is the wholesome or positive dhamma, while the dhamma of degeneration (devolution) is the unwholesome or negative dhamma. There is a special law of action which transcends both of them (i.e., positive and negative). This is the Noble Eightfold Path. Human beings have mind and body. Evolution of the mind is more important than physical evolution, which is also based in the mind. Therefore, if the human mind does not evolve, human will retreat into monkey, hell being and hungry shades. There are ways to evolution and devolution, and Buddha Dhamma is for this purpose. Even it has a special way to transcend them. All the discourses in the Pāli Nikāyas are related to these three paths. For worldly evolution and devolution, there are two important suttas in the Sutta Nipāta—these are: Maṅgala (Blessings) Sutta and Parābhava (Downfall) Sutta. Therefore, Buddha's Dhamma is an education related to humans. Without this noble education, humans never know how to deal with their mental defilement and solving the human problems, instead, they will always nourish their defiled minds!

It's amazing to see humans never learn from their mistakes and do the wrong things or following the wrong ways to deal with their problems. The worst thing is even they don't consider it as a problems—e.g., some world leaders, governments and politicians. They are making the same mistakes and problems again and again and never learnt from the history of the world. Humanity has created many problems in the world today that support this important point.

Western discoveries and inventions in science and technology created Western hedonism, leading to insatiable lust and greed, creating colonisation around the world. The two world wars of the 20th century began in the West. After the 2nd World War, there was a Cold War between capitalism and communism. After the Soviet Union collapsed, communism was nearly in demise. What is happening in the world in this 21st century? In the field of political influence and economy, there are still confrontations, rivalries, struggles and battles between the superpowers, up to the international level.

So the Buddha Dhamma and world history teach us that material progress or evolution is not true progress because it is based on hedonism and represents desire, greed, lust, selfishness, jealousy, delusion, etc. These unwholesome dhammas will lead to the devolution of mankind. It will create disharmony, no peace and happiness, and lead to suffering. Therefore, material progress must go hand in hand with the mind or mental progress or development. This gap can be filled by the wholesome and noble education of ancient sages and Buddhism. Actions based on wrong views, wrong ideas and wrong actions will never bring peace and happiness on earth. Man can create Heaven or Hell on this beautiful earth.

Conclusion

Sayadaw U Candima own experiences and teachings are clearing away of the views, opinions, speculations, etc. on samādhi and insight practices by scholars and practitioners. Among modern Buddhists, there is much confusion and doubt about the Buddhist practice of samatha and vipassanā. His interpretation of samatha-yānika way of practice is similar to the lifestyle of the Thai forest monks of Ajahn Mun's tradition. Vipassanā-yānika way is suitable for the long retreat in a meditation center, or in a secluded place for some longer period. His interpretation of the practice as it relates to pain is also reasonable. In Samatha practice yogi can change and correct the posture with pain but not in vipassanā practice. In Samatha practice, the yogi can change or correct postures with pain, but not in vipassanā practice. The reason behind this is that for samatha-yānika it takes time to develop jhāna samādhi with signs (nimitta), but for vipassanā-yānika it takes a shorter time to develop vipassanā meditation and one has to deal with suffering directly. We also see that developing a samma-samādhi is not an easy task.

One of the mistaken view on vipassanā Samādhi is on khaṇika-samādhi which is not the ordinary samādhi of moment to moment sati in daily life. It is the vipassanā jhanic samādhi (or vipassanā jhānas mentions by the commentary) or animitta cetto samādhi or upekkhā eggakkta samādhi which has the quality of the 4th rūpa jhāna.

Another important issue is the authenticity of the Abhidhamma doctrine, which some extreme Westerners strongly deny. But U Candima's direct experiences reject their wrong view, opinion and speculation. Surprisingly, some of them were strongly opposed to Abhidhamma and commentary, yet they readily accepted the knowledge of Western philosophers and used them to study Buddhism. They had faith in some of the well-known western philosophers, but not in the Buddhists who were scholars and practitioners of the past centuries and handed down the teachings.

From the experience and teachings of U Candima, we also know that the views or knowledge of the saints (ariya) (from Buddha to sotāpanna) are quite different from the views of the worldly people; we can even say that they are opposite to each other. The worldlings see the world superficially and very coarse because of their defiled minds. Even with different levels of mental purity, the world is seen differently—from the precise to the more refined and subtle.

If we do not have many of the blessings mentioned in the Discourse of Blessings, then it is not easy to become a Buddhist in the cycle of many lifetimes. Now that we are in this era with Buddha's teachings (Buddha Sāsana), we should not waste our precious time as ordinary Buddhists do. Because we cannot take anything with us after death. As a human being and Buddhist we have three duties—not to do evil (unwholesome dhammas), to do good (wholesome dhammas) and purify the mind. These three Buddhist duties are also related to knowledge and conducts (vijjā and caraṇa). So this human world is a cultivation of goodness and wisdom faculties. (Therefore, this human world is a cultivation of the ability to be kind and wise.) Only as a Buddhist, we have the chances to follow these duties with the education of Buddha Dhamma. The Buddha also warned us that the frequent homes of living beings were the three woeful planes of existence—hell, animal and hungry shades. We are not born as human beings to see the sights and find sensual pleasures in this world.

The Buddha teaching is a way of life. So it is better and more beneficial if we can use the Dhamma in our daily life. Here I want to introduce Ajahn Chah's teachings to the readers. Among all the Thai forest ajahns (teachers) Luang Por Chah is quite unique. He is able to train and teach not only monks and nuns, but also lay community (lay people). He is a wise figure and has many skills in teaching and training people. It seems to me that many Buddhists (and perhaps even non-Buddhists) around the world have benefited from Luang Por's teaching. I have no doubt about it. His teaching is simple yet profound and easy to understand. Simplicity is beauty and a clear mind. It was like Japanese bonsai or Zen Gardens arts.

The last important point with want to emphasize is the teaching of the Maṅgala Sutta—the Discourse in Blessings. This important discourse is important for all people—Buddhists or non-Buddhists. It is a wholesome and noble education for all living beings (even it had a strong influence) on celestial beings who posed the question to the Buddha.). Those who follow this doctrine in this life will not only bring wealth and happiness in this life; but also wealth and happiness in the next life.
