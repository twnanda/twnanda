        Raining is the same for all, if you fill the rain water with a barrel and you’ll get a barrel of water. If with a bucket then you’ll get a bucket of rain water, etc. If you overturn them all and you will get nothing. If you fill it for drinking and become drinking water; for washing only then it becomes washing. But it’s raining the same for all. In practicing Dhamma the teacher’s wisdom must be right. The students follow him with their saddha, viriya, sati, ….the 5 spiritual strength also must be strong. 
  In clapping two hands together if one hand is soft or light and the other strong then the sound is not louder. In the same way teacher and students are 2 sides of 2 hands. If the teacher is wrong he has to correct himself and vice versa. 
  We need to open about it. The Buddha taught us to be careful in making inquiry on teachers. We could take someone as a teacher if he had the quality. If you find a good teacher even he drives you out with beating do not leave him.  
  Now, you find a good teacher even I am not beating you yet but you want to run away from me. You want to run away because it’s painful I can’t bear it. You become not a good student if a good teacher. 
  (I am sure U Candima is a tough teacher and this is his character. So people want to train by him also have to be tough, patient and endurance. For young and strong people should find this kinds of teacher.) 
  In ānāpāna breathing some breathe slowly, some breathe strongly and others breaths a bit more stronger. Even though mentioned as slow and strong breathings one has to choose one’s preference with basic and main method. Breathing with acceleration was mentioned in commentary as kakacupama method – the simile of sawing wood method. A man was cutting a wood with a saw. Could it be cut off if sawing very slowly? The wood will not cut off and not going very far. If sawing the wood is like battling by force and you can’t do it longer. You becomes overtired. The man cut the wood in a way not slow and not with very strong force but had acceleration by sawing it back and forth. He was paying attention to the sawing. If he pushed the saw forward 7” and pulled backward also 7”. Pushing the saw forward length and pulling the saw backward length were whether short or long, going in and coming out had to be equal. 
  The first cutting was 7” forward and 7” backward, and the second cutting also the same. (not changing the rate). He sawed the wood regularly in this way. He was listening the sheli cutting sound and on the other hand looking at the cutting place by pushing and pulling the saw back and forth regularly. (Here Sayadaw gave a very good example how to use the ānāpāna breathing according to their system. With the machine it’s more clearer).

  Manuscript P. 57
  With the slow breathing when the afflicted dukkha vedana is strong and one’s samadhi also low, all these make the mind falling toward vedana. With forced breathings become very tired and jhana not arises. Because the mind is tired and can’t breathe longer period. Therefore slow and strong breathings are not good. This is at basic level. 
  It’s like the saw man not strong and soft strength. The in going breath and the out going breath – their breathing rate and acceleration have to be equal. The long and short air passages have to be the same. It’s not too strong and too soft. You must breathe like this. It was like the saw man looking at the place of contact the saw teeth touching the wood. You must breathe pay attention at the place where the breath and nostril are touching. During the breathing it must not be too strong and too soft. 
  The acceleration, short and long breaths of in and out breaths must be the same. 
  The first in and out breaths and later in and out breaths must be the same. 
  This way of breathing is like the saw man with the strength of not strong and soft sawing the wood in regular way that he could saw it longer and finish the job. He is also not tired with it. With this kind of breathing rate have to do the basic kamatham. In this way of breathing you need the strength of sending the mind at the point of contact and within an hour (or 2 hrs) not correcting or adjusting the body. With this kind of strength, you let go of the desire to change and correct the body. For a saw man he doesn’t have this. For the yogis they have it. 
  At one side the mind doing the ānāpāna breathing and the other side the mind instigate you to change and correct the body because of vedana. You must totally abandon the desire to change and correct the  body which the nind instigate you to do ti. Let the mind stays with sati at the touching point of the nostril at the same rate of acceleration and breathings. In case if vedana becomes stronger or one’s own breathings become soft or the mind wants to go down there you have to increase a little bit of your original breathing rate and continue with it. This is made the touching point more clearer. Beware of the touching point and breathe a little bit stronger. But out of fear you must not breathe blindly without any control like a battle and without any rules. Whatever with strong breathing if you don’t have sati and viriya (mindfulness and effort) the mind not arrive at the touching place and instead it moves down there. It becomes useless even though the nose doing the breathings and the mind at vedana. If both of them are strong (i.e., breathings and vedana)  it becomes tired. 
  The main point is the harmony of long and short, slow and fast, strong and soft breathings which are not tiresome. If you’re not contemplating long and short, slow and fast breathings then the mind has free time and it goes down there (i.e., to dukkha vedana). If you’re contemplating the mind even not has free time it has to aware of the touching point. The yogi has to make effort at in and out breathings, also contemplate and examine the harmony of long and short breathings as sawing the wood, and also he has to control and adjust the in and out breathings become harmonious in the long and short, strong and soft breathings. (Here his sentences are very long with repetition.

  Manuscript P. 58
  Saddha, sati and viriya with these 3 factors if you are able to stick the mind on the kamatham object with stability and it can’t incline down there. Without inclining and there is no connection. If there is no connection and there is no good or bad taste about it. Without it and there is no enjoyment. It becomes lobha if taking enjoyment with sukha (sukha vedana). If experience with dukkha becomes disappointed with dosa. The mind becomes upekkha-samadhi at the point where the air touching the nostril if adandoning all gladness and sadness. 
  [ If we reflect the first 4 tetrad of ānāpānasati sutta – the first and second steps use the word (know or discern the long and short breaths). The third and fourth steps use the word – train himself sensitive to the entire body and calming the bodily formation or fabrication. So it’s not a simple practice and need intelligence and discernment with experiments. Here we can see this point. ]
  Don’t want to feel or experience dukkha when the 4 great elements are disturbed or changed is dosa. Wanting to change and correct the body is lobha. Free from these 2 extremes the mind stick with the touching and knowing at the entrance of the nostril, it becomes upekkha vedana of neither pleasant nor unpleasant feeling (i.e., asukha and adukkha). 
  The yogis have to remember is not arriving at upekkha samadhi can’t contemplate with insight. Still even one does not know himself as not arriving at upekkha level yet and do the contemplation even for 10 aeons can’t attain Dhamma (i.e., Nibbana). 
  Without upekkha samadhi and doing anicca, dukkha and anatta is not Dhamma (i.e., vipassana Dhamma). The sound seems to be similar the causes are different. (It’s only reciting anicca, dukkha, anatta with concepts and not direct discernment.) 
  This is the reason behind not changing dukkha vedana when the 4 elements disturbed or afflicted. Disappointment with anger (dosa) is unwholesome (akusala) and called as domanassa-dejection. Lobha is called abhijjha-covetous (here wanting the pain to go away). The mind not stick here (at pain) and staying at the tip of the nostril become upekkha. This is the ocarse type of momentary upekkha samadhi. 
  At the time the mind sticks at the tip of the nostril has no dosa, it frees from the dosa toad (toad represents dosa). It’s not really free yet. When it frees from sati the toad appears again. (Sati is not strong enough on the object and pull down by the pain). There are 3 kinds of freedom – tadanga (for short period), vikkhambhana (suppression) and samuccheda (eradication). 
  If you can collect the mind on the object for tadanga will free from dosa. It’ll appear again (i.e., pain) if you can’t do it. Now present ānāpāna is tadanga practice .Whatever system or method we use in accordance to the Buddha at first it was like striking a brass bell after the “Dong” sound the sound becomes louder and slowly becomes smaller and disappears. This is called pasambhayam-kayasankharam-calming the bodily formation or fabrication (i.e., the breath). If you breathe with ānāpāna similar to the way of sawing a wood it must refine slowly. It becomes refined not by oneself and happening naturally when the mind frees from unwholesomeness.
  We don’t need to kill the enemy. If there is enemy to protect ourselves have to fight them. Now it’s leading by sati and viriya that unwholesome mind or mental states can’t come near. It’s no need to run away from them.
  When it arrives to wholesome mind process and jhanic mind process with the breathing it slowly becomes quiet and after that the bhavanga-heart base with a sensation in the chest something was fall of and the breathing stops. It doesn’t breathe and also it can’t breathe. There is pain, aches and numbness down there but the mind is not suffered.
