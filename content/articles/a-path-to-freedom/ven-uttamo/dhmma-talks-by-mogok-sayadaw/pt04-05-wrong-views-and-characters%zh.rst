:summary: Wrong Views & Characters (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 9th December 1961

Wrong views come from inversions (vipallāsa). Someone with the sassata nature is taking enjoyment in the life of existence. So it’s far from Nibbāna. Someone with uccheda nature appreciates Nibbāna. With sassata does not like Nibbāna. Uccheda prefers to be nothing is happening again. They believe in born only once & die only once in lifetime. It doesn’t make any difference to them. I urge people who have these wrong views must practice for themselves to see the reality. 

The reality & the knowing have to be fit together. The body whenever you observe, it exists only anicca, dukkha, anatta & dukkha sacca. If the reality of the body & the knowing mind are fitting together, it becomes cakkhu maṁtosa passanti_the person with eyes can see it.

If not you were born with blindness & died with blindness. This was said by the Buddha in the Udāna Pali. Most Buddhists die without seeing impermanence, but they know only born once & die once in one lifetime. These people born in the darkness & die in the darkness. They can’t revolt the inversions (vipallāsa) that they are crazy & blind. This body exists as impermanent phenomena and not seeing this is blind. 

But we take the not existing things as my son, my wife, etc. is crazy. So don’t want to become a crazy & blind corpse. If you want, then the king doesn’t go to the heaven & the monk doesn’t fly up to the heaven. (These usages in Burmese language are respectful ways of saying about the king & the monk are passing away). 

Both of them suffer in woeful plane (apāyabhūmi; because of wrong views) and dive into the earth (i.e, hell). (And then Sayadaw told the story of a group of blind brahmins and an elephant). All of them didn’t know the whole elephant. In the same way human beings only know the outer forms as son, wife, etc. But they don’t know what happen inside & then die. 

They die as crazy & blind people. Even you are a 2 rooted person, if you can practice & discern impermanence, then you will finish your goal in next life. (Regarding 2 rooted person in some of Sayadaw’s talks, can’t discern anicca. May be it referred to the highest levels of anicca, or some of his listeners were already discerned anicca. So he encouraged them to continue their practice. 

Anyhow yogis should not concern about the Dhamma duty or procedure. He should concern only practice rightly & checking his mistakes & correcting them). If you don’t work for practice & next life also will born in the darkness & die in the darkness again. You are not only living in the darkness but also crazy. Without cure your blindness & craziness even a Brahma god can become a pig & an Universal Monarch a dog (anything can happen to a worldling). Everything was happening before to a living being but except Nibbāna. (Because saṁsāra or the beginningless round of rebirths is very long to all beings)

A person not in the middle way is going randomly and in the extreme. The 2 extremes are not free from ageing, sickness & death. And also can’t find the way of freedom. Without cure the blindness & craziness will be never in the middle way. Beings are moving like an earth worm. A chicken is waiting in front of it. It doesn’t know about this & going towards the chicken. 

Therefore it becomes the food for the chick. In the same way living beings are eaten by the king of the Death. You can smile only when you are in the middle way. You can smile after seeing impermanence, disenchantment & the ending of the conditioned phenomena. Without these is only the smiling of a blind & crazy person. 

Inversion of wrong view (ditthi vipallāsa) over power us that we are always going towards the path of death. If you are looking at it with knowledge and this khandha is dying for many times within a day. So if someone became a sotāpanna and the Buddha referred to him as āloko udapādi–attained the knowledge of light. It will only become bright by getting the seed of Path Knowledge. After discern anicca and yiu get the knowledge in accordance with the truth (saccanulomika nyan). 

This knowledge becomes mature will see the real dukkha. It’s difficult to talk people to appreciate these things. What they prefer is the path to good rebirths, because they have inversions with them. If your eyes can see, then you are in the middle way. You discern impermanence and it becomes the seed of a noble being (ariya). Most of us took rebirths as animals in our past lives because human existences were difficult to obtain (Some yogis could discern their past lives also supported this point).

Therefore the Buddha said that we should be disgusted & loathed to this khandha. If you have the khandha, & even will not kill by others, must bite to death by the 4 snakes within it (And them Sayadaw mentioned how the 4 great elements changed in the body & led to deaths).

The Buddha explained the characters of blind & crazy people. People held the view of permanence (sassata ditthi) believe in next life & the result of good & evil. Prefer to do good & afraid of evil.

May be you all think him as a moral person. Even if he meets a good teacher and stays away from practice to realize Nibbāna (There was a close disciple named U Mya, a wealthy business man. If he had the chance to meet Sayadaw would never stay longer, but only a few days for his talks. Sayadaw always asked him to stay longer for practice but he neglected & died unexpectedly). 

These people (sassata) even if they met the Buddha would not do it & not giving up their views. Their faults are small but very difficult to transcend dukkha (Most later Buddhists are this type. They have bhava tanhā & also encourage others to do the same). They are very reluctant to cut off the khandha process. They can’t give up their sensual pleasure. They are gentle nature. Pretend to be moral people & don’t want to come out from the round of existence (vatta). 

Therefore it’s difficult to help them for liberation. It’s refine & difficult wrong view. Like the head hairs of a small baby difficult to shave. The faults of uccheda people are heavy, but they are easily to give up their views. They believe in life & kamma but don’t want to cultivate wholesome actions. They can do unwholesome things. If they listen to talks & have faith in it easy to transcend dukkha. The difficult things is most of you are sassata people. If you have the eye sight both of these views will fall away. 

Uccheda people even at the utmost can make a vow to become a bodhisatta. Between the two views, uccheda person is more closer to Nibbāna. If you discern the impermanence of any khandha both wrong views are gone. By seeing the arising is uccheda view, with the passing away is sassata view & both will fall away. So discerning of impermanence is very beneficial. Go & study the Pali Suttas, most of them were talking about the rise & fall (udaya & vaya), i.e, impermanence. Why is that? Because it can revolt wrong views. Now, you have encountered the Buddha’s Teachings and must do this task. 

If not you will incline towards one side. Therefore I am asking you very often that do you discern impermanence? The same as do you have the eye-sight yet? It doesn’t mean to see all of them. Here feeling arises & then not here. Mind arises & then not here. To know the overview of it. These are important so that I have to tell you. Even in the past lives before, you might be met one of the Buddhas, but one of these wrong views prevented you from liberation. Distinguish by characters sassata person is lust temperament (rāga caritta). Uccheda person is hatred temperament (dosa caritta).

If he doesn’t want to do something whatever reason he will not do it. They are blunt people (If they have faith in the Dhamma can give up their lives for the practice). They are sharp & sassata people are soft. The Buddha taught a lot of things in details, & nothing was left behind (The Buddha never had a secret teaching or left somethings behind for others to discover). 

Even in the end he allowed the monks to adopt some of the minor rules for the practice. All of you are understanding the Dependent Arising very well (Sayadaw taught many years to them by using D.A). So don’t doubt about yourself as in the middle way or not? Dependent Arising teaches you the cause & effect of the impermanent phenomena. So you are in the middle way. 

Only you need to take care of it ending. The khandha like the flowing water always in the impermanent states. It tells you only these. It’s like as you are watching at one of the place of flowing river. The upper part of the water flowing in & the lower part of the water flowing away? The cessation of rise & fall (udaya & vaya) is Nibbāna.
