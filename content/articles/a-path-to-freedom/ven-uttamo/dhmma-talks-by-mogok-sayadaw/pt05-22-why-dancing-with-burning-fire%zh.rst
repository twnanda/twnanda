:summary: Khandha Fuel with Kilesa Fire (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 13th May 1961

A person discerns impermanence is near to Nibbāna. If the causes are conducive and it doesn’t take very long. This point came from the Udana Pali. Worldlings are happy with taking pleasure in the khandhas which they desire for it. For the noble ones (ariyans), these are getting the fuels and fire. Eleven types of fire are burning all the time. 

Therefore listening dhamma talks are fixing the deluded eyes with the ariyan eyes. The 31 realms of existence are big piles of fire. With prayer for asking any khandha is only for the fuels. 

Khandha fuels burnt out and kilesa fire gone out is Nibbāna. The 5 khandhas are fuels. The eleven types of fire is fire (e.g. lobha, dosa, moha, soka, etc.) They can’t seperate.

Fuels are vipaka vatta—the result of the round of existence. Fire is kilesa vatta— the defilement of the round of existence. Two vattas are going together. If you are happy with both of them and taking in pleasure to burn yourself. Vipassanā practice is battling with the kilesas latent in the khandha. 

You have to extinguish the kilesa fire in the khandha. Must using the holy water of the path to extinguish it. If there are fuels and fire exist, and there must also exist the extinguishing of fire.

This is not a fable (i.e, just like other faiths and belief systems) This was known by the Buddha directly before and taught to the living beings. Nibbāna really exists as the fuels and fire have been extinguished. 

Before talking about Nibbāna, first have to mention about the evil and terrible things. Doesn’t know the bad things who wants to like the good one. During the time of each one of the past Buddhas many had enlightened. Is there anyone of them come back? 

(This is an important point for Buddhists to contemplate. Because some people have the idea that in the cosmos there are permanent places for permanent beings. This is an eternalist view and bhava tanhā. It’s defilements.) 

Without knowing to get the khandha is getting the fuels and fire. This is ignorance. After getting and taking pleasure in it is craving/tanhā. Now, you have caught the culprit. I’ll show you the way out of it.

We have to take the examples of people who were going out from it before. They had left from saṅkhata. The 5 khandhas are saṅkhata dhamma. By seeing saṅkhata dhamma and , become disenchantment with it. And with the cessation of it, will reach asaṅkhata. Saṅkhata and saṅkhāra are the same (i.e, conditioned phenomena). 

Form arises by action, mind, temperature and foods (kamma, citta, utu and ahara). Mind arises by arom and dvara (sense objects and sense doors). Therefore mind/body arise by the conditioning of other. Sabbe saṅkhāra anicca — All conditioned phenomena were impermanent as said by the Buddha. So if you discern impermanence and you find out the beginning of the path.

If become disenchantment with it you are ready to get out from it. If you want to free from saṅkhāra, mind/body (saṅkhāra) will disappear. In the practicing knowledge fuels and fire are extinguished. 

You arrive to Nibbāna which is nobody can make it arises or disappears. Seeing impermanence, become disenchantment and not wanting of it will sure arrive to Nibbāna. Remember these 3 points.
