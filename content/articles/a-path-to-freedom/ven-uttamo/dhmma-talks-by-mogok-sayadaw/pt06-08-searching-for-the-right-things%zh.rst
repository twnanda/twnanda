:summary: Searching for the Right Things (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 28th June 1961

A person doesn’t know the truth is only turning towards dukkha. Men are searching for women and women are searching for men. They are searching for the wrong thing. The real searching is for the truth. The truth is still existing in the world but people are searching for dāna, sila and samatha practices. 

(Sayadaw gave the simile of a blind turtle in the ocean for the rarity of getting the human existence. After that continued to talk about the Bodhisatta’s 2 former teachers, Ālara Kalama and Uddaka Rāmaputta.

They were arūpajhana attainers but did not have the chance for enlightenment. Sayadaw wanted to emphasize the difficulty of having the opportunity to practice the truth). 

These examples are describing your power of the good kamma. And therefore do not be lazy. Even the Bodhisatta without

knowing the truth sometimes born as animals ( For e.g, Bhuridatta, the Serpent King or King of Nāga. This point is very important. Any being without destroying the seed of the identity view – sakkāya ditthi can be fall into the 4 planes of misery in the round of existence. 

Even the real Bodhisattas are no exception & no need to say about the unreal ones. There were 550 Jataka Stories of the Buddha’s past lives as Bodhisatta & he was born as animals for many times. In one life as the prince Taymiya, even had mentioned once in hell before. 

But there are some misconceptions about Bodhisattas always living in Heaven & other things). In the world there is no greater fault than not knowing the truth. (Sayadaw explained the 3 knowledges as mentioned in the First Discourse of the Buddha. 

These are; Sacca Nyan, Kicca Nyan & Kata Nyan. May be can be translated as theoretical knowledge, practical knowledge & resultant knowledge). Sacca Nyan is the lower knowledge. Kicca Nyan is the middle knowledge. Kata Nyan is the higher knowledge. Listening to what I am saying & paying attention to the khandha. 

Whatever arising in the khandha & knowing as dukkha sacca is Sacca Nyan (Exception of lobha) It’s not including anicca yet. At the moment of arising & knowing is Sacca Nyan. Wanting something or wanting to do something is Samudaya Sacca (only lobha). Samudaya ceases is Nirodha Sacca. 

To know whatever arising is Magga Sacca. All these are ordinary knowing. This is with the help of a teacher These are the way of knowing in details (Not a combined knowing). 

Everytime dhamma arises in the khandha by knowing these 4 points with the analytical knowledge is Sacca Nyan. Even this lower knowledge is not everyone knowing it. Knowing these things are coming from the help of a teacher’s explanation. Even Ālara Kālāma & Uddaka Rāmputta didn’t know this knowledge. 

This way of knowing was listening to the dhamma by the group of 5 monks. (Pañca_vaggiyā bhikkus, (the first 5 disciples of the Buddha). Never heard about these dhammas how can someone knows the arising dhamma. Everytime with the truth of arising & knowing of it is Sacca Nyan. Kicca Nyan – whatever arises in the khandha is rising & passing away. Knowing thoroughly as impermanence is dukkha sacca. 

Knowing thoroughly as it is dukkha arising & dukkha vanishing. This is fully understanding of dukkha sacca (pariññāya). There is nothing exist except of Dukkha Sacca. Kicca is one thing & Nyan is another thing (The object is kicca & contemplative mind is nyan). Kicca Nyan is the practice (contemplation). If you don’t have this

knowledge and become a disadvantaged person. Penetrative knowing is knowing thoroughly. Sacca Nyan is ordinary knowing. Contemplation is doing the Kicca Nyan. I am worrying about you is Nyan not turning towards the Khandha’s Kicca (Function of the Khandha). Khandha is always telling us its function. Nyan not turning towards it that cannot get the Kicca Nyan.
