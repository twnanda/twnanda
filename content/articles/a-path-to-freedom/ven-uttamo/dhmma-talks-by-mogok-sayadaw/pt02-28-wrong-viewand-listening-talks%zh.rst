Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 27th March 1959

Not only listening to the talks of outsiders (other faiths) has wrong views, but also listening to the Buddhist teachings has wrong views. As example, regarding to dāna, if I do it, I will get the result. This is kammasakata nyan. It can’t transcend the planes of asava (taints). It’s inside the province of the taint of view (ditthasava). The wholesomeness of dāna (merits of dāna) is called tainted merits (Asavakusala Dhamma) and can’t realize Nibbāna without knowledge (nyan). Therefore, whatever merits you are doing using knowledge together. The Buddha taught conventional truth was for the Kammasakata Nyan. He taught the ultimate truth (paramatha sacca) for the purpose of Path and Fruit Knowledges. Therefore, with care and not incline towards one sided. If inclining towards one sided become extreme. We must distinguish between the province of kamma and nyan. The province of kamma is 31-realms of existence. The province of nyan is transcending the 31-realms of existence. When we are doing merits must lead by knowledge. In this way, kammasakata nyan is following behind the leading sacca nyan. Without these knowledges, beings are wandering around the 31-realms of existence. Therefore, doing merits and goodness not let it leading by tanhā samudaya but knowledge. In this way, it will directly give the result to Nibbāna. If your causes are not good so the results. In life everytime we encounter difficulties and inconveniences, don’t complain as don’t have the good results, but knowing as our causes are not good. When encounter family problems and social problems become stress but don’t complain. It’s only the beginning and more dukkha will come. You will still have to encounter the dukkha of old age, sickness and death. To get the scales of knowledge must listen to Sacca Dhamma. In this way when you are listening to talk, you can distinguish right and wrong.
