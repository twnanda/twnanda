:summary: The Wise and the Fool (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 11th December 1960

(In this talk Sayadaw was using the first verse of the 38 highest blessings—Mangala Sutta for the teaching. “Not to associate with fools; to associate with the wise; to honour those worthy of honour”) A fool (bālā) doesn’t mean a person is foolish but for the dhamma latent in the mind. 

In the same way the wise (panditā) also not a person but the dhamma. The mind has ignorance (avijjā) & becomes the fool. The mind has knowledge (vijjā) & becomes the wise. We have to decide by the dhamma latents in the mind. Association with what is good becomes wise & bad becomes a fool. Not knowing is ignorance (avijjā) & foolishness is sankhara (kammic formation). 

Take the 5 khandhas as man & woman who are not exist is foolishness. Contemplation of the impermanence of the khandha is wise. By dying in this way is worthy of honour (pūjā ca pūjanīyānaṁ). Someone dies by clinging to the khandha as a living being is the corpse of a fool. If you associate with impermanence will realize the incomparable Nibbāna.
