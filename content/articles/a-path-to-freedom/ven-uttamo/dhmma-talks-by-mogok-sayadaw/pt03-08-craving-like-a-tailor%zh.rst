Most Buddhists afraid of unwholesome kamma which will give the future result. The main cause is not kamma, tanhā (craving) is the connector from one life to another to infinity. If tanhā is eradicated and no birth anymore. After tanhā extincts all the kammas become fruitless, as an example, the great serial killer Aṅgulimāla (the fingers garlanded bandit of the Buddha’s time). Therefore, the Buddha said that in the Four Noble Truth the cause of dukkha is craving, and not mentioned as kamma. Craving is sticking at 12 places. It’s sticking with the 12 āyatanas; i.e form, sound, smell… ideas and eye-base, ear-base, nose-base…mind-base, sticking with the external and internal phenomena, and also in the middle. It’s really not easy to deal with it. With the contact of eye and visual object, eye-consciousness (seeing) arises. So it’s also sticking with the eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness (hearing), nose-consciousness (smelling)…mind-consciousness. So tanhā is sticking at 18 places (6 sense-objects+6 sense-bases+6 consciousness=18 elements). Even you can say sticking with the whole body. Therefore, we have the usage of I can’t even let one of my head hairs to fall off. Again it’s sticking with the 18 feelings (6-sense-doors x 3 types of feeling; i.e pleasant, unpleasant and neutral). The 18 elements (dhātus) are connecting with the 3 types of feeling. So if you can contemplate the 3 types of feeling, and it’s enough to kill tanhā. If feeling can be contemplated, and craving is not arising. So the Buddha gave the contemplation of feeling (vedanānupassanā).

Whatever name you are calling to the living beings such as human, god, brahma…etc., in reality dukkha starts and dukkha ends (birth and death). Only these things are continuously happening. Only exist as dukkha connects to dukkha. Without any goodness in it. After his enlightenment the Buddha observed the world with the eye of truth and said that I would never praised to any life of existence as good. Even became a non-returner (anāgāmin) was only one more life to go on but still not good yet. It was liked the 4 piles of excrement and still one pile left behind. It was good only with all were gone.
