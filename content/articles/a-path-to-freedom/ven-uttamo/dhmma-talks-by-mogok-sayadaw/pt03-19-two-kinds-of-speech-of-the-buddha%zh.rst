:summary: Two Kinds Of Speech Of The Buddha (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 30th Dec.1957 / 25th March 1960

There are 6 kinds of speech by man. (The Buddha only used 2 of them.) These are:

| 1. Not good, not true, not benefit, people don’t like it.
| 2. Good, true, not benefit, people don’t like it.
| 3. Good, true, benefit, people don’t like it.
| 4. Not good, not true, not benefit, people like it.
| 5. Good, true, not benefit, people like it.
| 6. Good, true, benefit, people like it.
| 

The Buddha used only No.3 and No.6 types of speech. These speeches also connection with sīla, so practitioner should follow these kinds of speech. Buddha used No.3 speech according to time and situation. If needed to be waited for the time and he waited for it. The Buddha used No.6 as soon as without delay. Sayadaw said he could not help lazy people, but can help people even they are dull until they understand. We should use these 2 kinds of speech skillfully in our daily life. These are using by noble and wise people.

The Buddha used 2 kinds of speech; (1) good, true, benefit and people don’t like it, we have to use it according to time and place. (2) good, true, benefit and people like it, we have to use it without delay. As an example, the Buddha used it to teach Bahiya Daruciriya before he died. After the teaching he was killed by a cow. Sacca dhammas are not popular to people, but the Buddha was using it for his whole life. The 2nd type of speech is very important because for living and dying, man can die anytime. Another point is concerning with young age and old age. When getting old difficult to listen dhamma talks and not easy for practice.

(Sayadaw talked about phassa – contact in practice.) Because of contact many feelings arise. If you can contemplate phassa until to the end is Nibbāna. But it’s difficult than feeling. Dukkha vedanā is coarser than sukha vedanā. Therefore, easier for contemplation. Whatever kind of feeling arise, contemplate anicca. Anicca is in the khandhas. The ending of it, also in the khandhas. Impermanence is dukkha sacca and the ending of it is nirodha sacca.
