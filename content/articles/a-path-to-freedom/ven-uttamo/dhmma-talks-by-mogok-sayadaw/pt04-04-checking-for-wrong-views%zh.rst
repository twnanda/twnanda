:summary: Checking for Wrong Views (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 9th December 1960

After this life & want enjoyment in next life is the view of eternalism (sassata ditthi). If you have done it & will receive it. This person will go there & enjoy the result is eternalism (sassata). After you have done & nothing is happening again. It’s just only functional (kiriya matta). It’s the view of annihilationism (uccheda ditthi). Viewing it as there is no any connection. (But for fully enlightened beings such as Buddha, Pacceka-buddha & arahat it’s only functional). 

Everybody has one of these views. With sassata view can’t realize Nibbāna, but can arrive to good destination (sugati). Uccheda view even can’t arrive to sugati but to the planes of misery (apāya bhūmi). These dhammas are for inner investigation. If you don’t give up these wrong view & even do the practice can’t realize Nibbāna. They forbid the Path & Fruit knowledges. (Magga & Phala). If you teach Nibbāna dhamma to sassata person he doesn’t like it. He is hiding himself in the round of existence. Don’t want to listen about the cessation of life. 

They like to realize Nibbāna slowly. Some people are very poor & have a lot of suffering & sorrow in lives that death is the only solution to them. Their philosophy is only born once & only die once & prefer the cessation of life. So they are uccheda people. They want to listen about the cessation of life. Both of these people are wrong. Because of the craving for becoming (bhavatanhā) sassata people don’t like Nibbāna. Wrong view is preventing them to realize it. 

They love to listen the enjoyment of life in the sutta discourses. For uccheda people when they listen vipassanā dhamma & prefer the cessation of life without understanding the cessation of dukkha. Both of them are not in the middle way, but inclining towards each polarity (i.e, eternalism & annihilationism).

I will talk about their nature. Sassata people believe in this life & after life. Doing wholesome actions & abstain from unwholesome action. If the Buddha & disciples taught them sacca dhamma & difficult to transcend dukkha. Because they take enjoyment in the becoming.

Uccheda people believe in this life & next life (My understanding of uccheda view is not believe in after life. May be here Sayadaw referred to some Buddhists who had uccheda view) & prefer the cessation of life. They are not doing wholesome actions. Dare to do unwholesome actions. But if they had the chances & listened to the teachings of the Buddha & disciples quickly renounced their wrong views. Worked hard to realize Nibbāna quickly. 

The one in the middle way has these knowledges. He has only 5 khandhas & these are impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha), notself (anatta) & foulness (asubha) dhamma & truth of dukkha. By analyzing the khandhas with knowledge & practice will see their passing away with blips. By seeing the arising dhamma is free from the annihilationism (uccheda) & seeing the passing away dhamma is free from eternalism (sassata). The person in the middle way free from both wrong views. 

He is not accepting the views of permanence & extinction. In the world (loka) there are the only existence of the arising dhammas & the passing away dhamma. There are no eternal & annihilated phenomena. Before people had sassata view because they didn’t see the passing away dhammas & had uccheda view because they didn’t see the arising phenomena. Before they didn’t have these insight. Therefore only by discerning impermanence that will be in the middle way. As an example you can use your finger nail scratches on your arm. 

You will find the feeling arising & disappearing. The object of contemplation is impermanent & the knowledge which know the object is also impermanent (here feeling & the knowing mind). This is the main reason why I myself had taught you for many years about these things. Only by discerning impermanence before that will follow by disenchantment after. 

If you don’t discern it & will be followed with pleasure. After the disenchantment do you have any desire for it? Seeing impermanence is the knowledge of as it really is (yathābhūtam nyan, the knowledge which drives away sassata & uccheda). Continue to contemplate & become disenchantment towards the phenomena is Nibbida Nyan (disenchantment of the arising dhamma & the passing away dhammas).

That sassata & uccheda cannot close near to the mind. This knowledge is beneficial to the Path Knowledge. By disenchanting to the khandhas is also to all the khandhas of 31 realms of existence. It is also the knowledge of disenchantment to the cemetery. If you have the khandha you have to look for a cemetery to bury it. 

When arriving to this knowledge even you are disenchanting to someone you want to associate or live with this person. Then the 8 path factors arise, & the khandha disappears. Dukkha sacca disappears & nirodha sacca arises. This is the Deathless Nibbāna. If you know only dukkha ceases (not a being) & free from uccheda ditthi. You should have sustained attention on the khandhas. From the time of discerning impermanence & can make a decision that you are at the entrance door of Nibbāna. 

But don’t be satisfied with it & continue for contemplation. Becoming disenchantment you are closer to Nibbāna city. Continue to contemplate until penetrate the arising dukkha & the passing away dukkha, then the 5 khandhas cease. Dukkha ceases is Nibbāna. From the time you are discovering anicca & making the decision that you will realize Nibbāna.
