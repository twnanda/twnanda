The beginning verse—a mind that, when touched by the ways of the world (i.e., the eight worldly dhammas—loka dhamma) is also related to #35, #36 and #37. First, we have to know what are the ways of the world.

There are eight numbers; as pair with positive and negative nature become four pairs. These eight loka dhamma are: gain and loss, status and disgrace, praise and censure, pleasure and pain. They are called the failings of the world or eight worldly conditions (loka dhammas). These worldly failings are more common in human beings than in other beings, and also a very interesting subject for contemplation.

No one can escape from these eight worldly conditions. So, everyone will encounter them. Not affect the mind by them are only the arahant. But with practice, wise reflection and contemplation, we can overcome them without shaking. Most people will think that they are as failings only encountering with the negative things such as loss, disgrace, censure and pain.

The positive things lead to pleasure and the negative to displeasure (i.e., like and dislike). The positive things are also the same because they have the nature of imperfection and change. Positive things can lead to negative things. For example, with wealth and power, people can do evil and unwholesome things. The Buddha taught the ways of dealing with them. These were:

(1) Acceptance as these failings of the world cannot be escaped.

(2) Acceptance as these failings of the world are the results of one’s actions (kamma)

(3) To understand these worldly conditions and their nature with contemplation to overcome them. This third point is more profound and important.

(4) Acceptance of the loka dhamma as part of human society and inescapable

There is a lot of this dhamma in human life, and their differences are only in many forms and magnitudes (great or small). These always exist in the world, as parts of human nature like birth, old age, sickness and death, and inescapable.

In the second discourse of the Loka-dhamma Sutta (Aṅguttara Nikāya, AN. 8.5 Paṭhamalokadhammasuttaṃ), the Buddha said; “These are the eight worldly conditions that spin after the world (i.e., human beings), and the world spins after these eight worldly conditions.”

It was like the law of kamma; the past life kammas (actions) had been done following with living beings and they were also always doing the actions. They are doing these things for the future to come. So, they are cause and effect relationship.

So, living beings cannot separate themselves from kamma that cannot free from the worldly dhamma. Even the Buddha and some of his chief and great disciples could not shun away from them. Once the time the Buddha and monks could not get any food that they had to eat some very coarse foods which were fed for horses. Ciñcamāṇavikā, who was a devoted pupil of other faith, accused the Buddha of having an affair with her. (DhA. iii. 178f; J. iv. 187F, Jātaka 472 Mahāpaduma Jātaka; ItA. 69)

Even the Buddha sometimes had sickness with pains. Ven. Mahāmoggallāna, the chief disciple of the Buddha, had been killed by the assassins, it was also connected with this worldly dhamma. Once, the Nigaṇṭha ascetic planned to kill him. Because they thought the diminishing of their fame and fortune was related to him. So, they hired some assassins to kill him. At last Ven. Mahāmoggallāna was caught by the assassins and he was beaten up until all his bones were broken.

Nobody frees or escapes from censure. How to deal with censure is also very important. We do not need to pay much attention to the fools who censure us. But we need to listen and pay attention to the wise and noble people for their censure. After that, we have to correct and improve ourselves. We need to live a life of blamelessness and praise by them.

This exhortation came from the Buddha regarding a layman Atula upāsaka. One time he and some followers went to see Ven. Revata, who was usually enjoying with his meditation attainments. So, he did not give any talk to them. They went to see Ven. Sāriputta and told about Ven. Revata. Therefore, Ven. Sāriputta gave a long talk to them. They also displeased with it.

And then they went to see Ven. Ānanda and reported him the account with Ven. Sāriputta. Therefore, Ven. Ānanda gave them a short talk. Still, they were displeased with the short talk.

At last, they went to see the Buddha. After hearing their report, the Buddha said as follows. Censure and praise didn’t exist only now. Whether keeping silence or talking a lot or talking with consideration still could not free or escape from censure.

At last the Buddha said that even he was not immune from it. Another story was, because of the Buddha’s excellent teachings and well practice of the Saṅgha and had a lot of support from people. This made other faiths censured them out of jealousy.

So, the Buddha taught the monks that whether living alone or with others in the world would encounter pain and pleasure. This was the way of the world. The important cause was not by others nor oneself, but the outcome of receiving the burdened khandhas (this point is important for contemplation.).


(2) Acceptance the loka-dhamma as the results of one’s kamma (actions)

Usually, people blame others for their sufferings, pain and displeasure. Here, we have two points to contemplate the outcomes of kamma. These are the results of the kamma and the existence of the khandhas. The results of kamma are quite an extensive subject.

Beings are always creating many different kinds of kamma by bodily, speech and mind. Therefore, the results of them are also many varieties. These are related to the worldly dhammas. If we experience misfortunes, it is better not to blame others or find faults with others. So, one has the responsibility for them.

If we react with anger or ill-will, our situations become worse. With unwise attention (ayoniso), we cannot solve or overcome the problem or situation. We have to contemplate wisely or dealing with them skillfully and then correct oneself. With the unskillful or unwholesome causes, one will encounter the negative things. And then, if we respond unskillfully, it will never become better.


(3) To understand the worldly dhammas and its nature with contemplation

This point is more important than others. This contemplation came from the second sutta on worldly dhamma in Aṅguttara Nikāya. The gist of it as follows:

The Failings of the World:
These and worldly conditions; i.e. gain/loss; status/disgrace; censure/praise; and pleasure/pain spin after the world, and the world spins after these and worldly conditions. For an ordinary uninstructed person (asutavā puthujjana), there arise these eight worldly dhammas. For a well-instructed disciple of the noble ones (i.e., sutavā ariya sāvaka), there also arises these eight dhammas. So, what are the differences between them?

The differences are:

When gain arises for an ordinary uninstructed person, and he doesn’t reflect; “Gain has arisen for me. It’s inconstancy (anicca), stressful (dukkha) and subject to change (vipariṇāma).” He doesn’t discern it as it is. (The other dhammas—loss, status… pain also in this way) His mind remains consumed with the gain, loss… etc.

He welcomes the arisen gain and rebels against the arisen loss. (The other pairs—status/disgrace, etc., in this way) As he is thus engaged in welcoming and rebelling, he is not released from birth, aging or death; from sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses or despairs.

Now, gain arises for a well-instructed disciple of the noble ones. He reflects; “Gain has arisen for me. It’s anicca, dukkha and vipariṇāma.” He discerns it as it is. His mind doesn’t remain consumed with the gain. (The other dhammas—loss, status, etc.,  are also in this way.) He doesn’t welcome the arisen gain or rebel against the arisen loss. (The other pairs, status/disgrace, etc.,  also in this way.)

As he thus abandons welcoming and rebelling, he is released from birth, aging and death; from sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses and despairs. He is released from suffering (dukkha). So, following with the Buddha’s instruction, when we encounter the eight worldly dhamma: gain/loss, status/disgrace, censure/praise and pleasure/pain.

We should contemplate them as: these conditions among human beings are impermanent, suffering and subject to change. People do not know the Buddha’s teachings and without practice, the worldly dhamma overwhelms them.

With the positive ones (such as gain), lust (rāga), craving (taṇhā), attachment (upādāna) overrun their minds. With the negative ones (such as loss), anger (dosa), ill-will, etc. overrun their minds. They cannot free or escape from problems and sufferings.

For someone who knows the Buddha’s teachings by practicing it, will see things and react in different ways. He understands the differences between positive and negative worldly dhammas (e.g., gain and loss). He also sees their common nature (i.e., anicca, dukkha and vipariṇāma). It is the same in vipassanā.

Mind and body have a particular nature (visesa lakkhaṇa or salakkhaṇa) and common nature (samaṇa lakkhaṇa). The 34th blessing is unshaken, 35th is sorrowless, 36th is dustless and 37th is secure. These qualities and blessings are referred to someone beyond training (asekha—i.e., an arahant). But others also can overcome them temporarily by practice and contemplation.
