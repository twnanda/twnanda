To reside in a suitable locality or good places. 

The Buddha mentioned the importance of locality or places for the development and progress in worldly and spiritual matters. What are the things to choose for a suitable locality? We should consider on education, economy, health, spiritual, etc. We will have no progress for our whole life if living at wherever we are in. It is the best place to reside where there is the chance to realize the path and fruit of the Buddha dhamma; a place where we can fulfill the perfection (paramis) of the Buddha's teachings.

We should reside in countries where there is the Buddha sāsana. In general, a place where can support us for making merits; obtain wealth, education, and health. We can also distinguish a place with three periods of human life span: when young a suitable place for education, during the middle period for wealth and the last period for spiritual progress.

There are six unsurpassed things – anuttariya dhamma. A place where we can fulfill these six noble dhammas is a blessing place. It must live in a suitable and good place to obtain them.

The six noble dhammas are:

| 1. the unsurpassed sight
| 2. the unsurpassed hearing
| 3. the unsurpassed gain
| 4. the unsurpassed training
| 5. the unsurpassed service
| 6. the unsurpassed recollection.
| 

The unsurpassed sight is seeing the Buddha and Saṅgha. The unsurpassed gain is faith – saddhā; having faith in the triple gems (Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha) and the law of kamma.

For ordinary worldly people, there are a lot of sights, hearing, and gains for worldly matters which never end. Some are quite harmful and polluting our hearts. To get the unsurpassed training is sīla, samādhi, and paññā. The unsurpassed service is serving the Buddha, Dhamma, Saṅgha, and to the parents. Serving the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha is very important for every Buddhist. Mostly we do not become aware or not knowing it profoundly. This is a very rare chance and opportunity. Why?

Because only a Buddha appeared that the triple gems came to existence. Even a Buddha appeared living beings must have had human births and also encountered them. Having a human birth is even quite difficult. In the whole of saṁsāra, we were slaves of our bodies and family members only.

Ledi Sayadaw was always looking for chances to serve the saṅgha. But the saṅgha stopped him from doing the services for them. What he had said or responded to them was very remarkable. He said; in the whole of saṁsāra, his hands were like the slave for the wives and children only. Therefore, he requested them to allow him for serving them. It is true; if we were doing a lot of services for the Triple Gems in saṁsāra and would not be here anymore.

Now, Buddhists should not miss this chance and opportunity. It is very rare to come by. Looking after the parents is also very important in human society. The Chinese filial piety – shao tao is very well known. This education and practices were handed down for many centuries, maybe more than over 5,000 years. Without love, kindness, and filial piety to one's parents, there is no future for someone.

The unsurpassed recollection is the qualities of Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha-Guṇas. There are a lot of worldly recollections to ordinary worldlings. It is good to have the recollection of one's parent kindness, love, and gratitude. And then, repay to them.

(Someone who can fulfill the six unsurpassed things has the seven benefits as mentioned in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta: purification of beings, surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, the disappearance of dukkha and discontent, acquiring the true method and realization of Nibbāna)

There was a good story of a sutta representing the anuttariya dhamma. One time the Buddha was going alms-round and met a group of people. He asked their names and livelihoods. One of them was the fisherman, and his name was Ariya – Mr. Noble. But his actions were ignoble. So the Buddha gave him talk on what was noble, and at the end, he entered the stream (became a sotāpanna). From an ignoble person and became a noble person (ariya). This was also he was living in a suitable place for his spiritual progress. (i.e., a place had the chance to meet the Buddha and listened to his talk).

Even if it is a suitable place for most people if someone is very bad and does not make any difference to this person (as, e.g., Devadatta and his followers), even can commit unwholesome actions. So it depends on each person. Therefore wholesome education is very important. In the Aṅguttara Nikāya, the Buddha taught about the eight unsuitable places – Akkhaṇa Sutta (AN.8.29/ 9. Akkhaṇasuttaṃ).

These are: hells, animals, ghosts-realms; Brahma gods with only mind and only physical body; a man or woman without roots; areas or countries the Buddha Dhamma cannot reach; people have wrong views and the time when no Buddha arose.
