:summary: Purification of the Mind: Citta-visudhi (Maṅgala Sutta – Protection with Blessing)

By Venerable Uttamo Thera（尊者 鄔達摩 長老）

This is referred to as samatha or samādhi (concentration) practices. Sīla only can purify the bodily & verbal unwholesome actions & not the mind. If the mind is not strong enough or in purity & easily break the precepts. The most important point for samādhi is it supports for discernment (paññā or knowledge).

The Buddha said; “Samahito yathabhūtaṁ pajanati – Someone has samādhi seeing things as it is.” Therefore sīla & samādhi are the two strong roots of a tree to grow. In many suttas, the Buddha referred to right concentration as the four material jhānas (rūpa-jhāna). This was a common process mentioned in the suttas. There was another way for right samādhi. This was paññā based samādhi.

So with momentary samādhi (khanika samādhi) also can develop knowledge. What are the differences between samatha based & vipassanā based samādhi? Samatha based samādhi is pleasant abiding, last longer & comfortable in practice. The commentary gave an example of crossing a river. Samatha based samādhi is like crossing a river by boat & vipassanā based samādhi is like swimming across the river. Both will arrive on the other shore.

Some people doubt the power of vipassanā based samādhi (i.e., khanika samādhi) can lead to realization. There was enough evidence among the yogis of the past & the present day yogis experiences. Every path & fruit has the jhānic power of samādhi. Citta-visuddhi has three kinds of samādhi; khanika samādhi (momentary concentration), upacāra samādhi (access concentration) & appanā samādhi (absorption concentration).

After the stage of the purification of the mind comes the 5 stages of the purification of knowledge follow (paññāvisuddhi); these are; the purifications of view (ditthi); the overcoming of doubt (vicikicchā); knowledge & vision of what is & what is not the path; knowledge & vision of the way; and knowledge & vision (Ñānadassanavisuddhi).

We can develop these five stages of purification only in the Buddha Dhamma. Therefore how much fortunate we are if we miss this chance knowingly and become the most foolish & stupid human being in the world.
