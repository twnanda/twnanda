Nearly all the Theravadin Buddhists heard this sutta chanting before. The Buddhist children learned it from monasteries and schools. At the time of the Buddha men and deities pondered, discussed and argued about the true meaning of blessings (maṅgala). Different people had a different view, and they could not agree to 12 years debates. They went to the Buddha for his answer, and he was staying in Sāvatthi at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.

The Buddha gave the answers to different kinds of blessings from mundane to supramundane levels. Buddhists recite it for blessings and free of dangers. Reciting is reminding us and for contemplation. The most important point is put into practice. All the Buddha's teachings were nearly on human beings and the human mind. It was more like education than a religion. A being born into the human world has two ways to choose and walk along on one of the paths.

One is downfall and failures. The other is development and success. These are the unwholesome and wholesome ways or negative and positive ways. All of them are related to the law of actions (kamma) or cause and effect. To choose the right one, we need wholesome education and have to rely on the teachings of the Buddha, noble beings, and ancient sages.

(It is also interesting to compare some of the mundane blessings mentioned by the Buddha with some of the teachings of the ancient Chinese sages. There were some similarities between them. Maybe this was one of the reasons Chinese people easily accepted Buddhism when it was spreading into China.)

We are learning the Maṅgala Sutta by heart even at a young age as children. But we are still distancing ourselves with it from the practical way of life. (It was the same as most Chinese with Di Gi Gui-Chinese Virtue Standards. Chinese moral or ethical education was handed down from ancient time until the end of the Ching Dynasty.) Therefore we have to study and learn it and then use it in daily life.
