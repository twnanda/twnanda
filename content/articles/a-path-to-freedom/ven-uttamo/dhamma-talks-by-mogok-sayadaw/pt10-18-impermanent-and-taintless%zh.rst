:summary: Impermanent and Taintless (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 30th May 1960

A person with the contemplation of impermanence and knowing of Impermanence is becoming taintless. With this, affection to the khandha of taint of sensuality (kamāsava) not arises. Thinking of it as it’s me, the taint of wrong view (ditthāsava) also not arises. Not knowing, the taint of ignorance (avijjāsava) also not arises.

Someone is doing the task of contemplating impermanence and knowing of impermanence becomes taintless. Become taintless means seeing the impermanence of one’s own khandha and others’ khandhas. Discerning of dukkha and anatta are in the same way. 

Why is that? Because it only becomes anicca and magga, anicca and magga, etc. in the process and āsavas can’t come in between them (Sayadaw explained as it was impossible by prayer and rely on outside power with the simile of the hen and her eggs). 

If you not contemplate, and then like the baby chicks die in the darkness of inside the eggs. It was like living in the darkness and dying in the darkness. Someone is discerning the beginning of the impermanence and continues the contemplation āsava will come to an end. 

It’s like the hen and you must do the 3 jobs of anicca, dukkha, and anatta. Seeing impermanence is fulfilling the task of anicca, dukkha and anatta. The Buddha also taught aniccā vata saṅkhāra – conditioned phenomena are truly impermanent. Maybe you’ll complain as you’re still with the seeing of impermanence.

In this same sutta the Buddha gave another simile, i.e., the simile of adze. If you contemplating impermanence, ñāṇa is slowly eroding the kilesas. Each day erodes a little bit, etc. and lobha, dosa and ditthi are becoming fewer than before. If you continue the practice, it thins out slowly and at last disappear.

Don’t think about it as no benefit. If you ask me, when it will be finished? If the impermanence are ending and it’ll finished.
