Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 4th February 1961

D.A. is one’s own khandha process and it’s going on every day. Don’t take them separately as different. This time it’s arising and this time it has to be cut off. That’ll not make it continues. If you don’t cut it off is collecting unwholesome kammas. You have to be very careful on this point. 

For example, on the body pleasant feeling arises. This is the arising of the D.A. of the khandha. After that the appreciation of taṇhā, saṅkhārakkhandha continues to arise. One khandha ceases and another khandha continues to arise. Let’s look at its cause and effect connection.

Vedanā paccaya taṇhā – feeling conditions craving, khandha continues to arise. This will continue to upādāna and kamma, so saṅkhārakkhandha are continuing to arise. One khandha ceases and another khandha arises. Vedanā and kamma are this life (vedanā→taṇhā→upādāna→kamma). Kamma paccaya jāti – action conditions birth. 

These are the birth of the five khandhas will arise in next life. And then jarā and maraṇa (ageing and death) khandhas continue. It is doing the job of connection of two lives. It has no demerits but looking for dukkha. Everyday these kammas are uncountable. These kammas are also anicca. 

So why shouldn’t it disappear? Because these taṇhā, upādāna are not yet abandon with the Path Knowledge. So, they are always as latent disposition in the mind. They are keeping all these kammas for not to disappear (Taṇhā is storing these kammic energy with it). 

If one of the kammic energy has finished and it sending out another one, etc. Then if you fall to the plane of misery can you come out again? There are many uncountable kammas of this life and past lives are in its storage.

Therefore, the Buddha said that there were no time limits of lifespan in the hells. If you’re making one mistake; “Do you have the chance to come out again?” Therefore, let us look for a refuge. It’s necessary to look for a dhamma making these kammas become fruitless. 

If not only dukkha sacca will arise. With the realization of sotāpatti magga (stream entry knowledge), the storage of many past lives and this present life unwholesome kammas become fruitless. If you are heedless and lazy, you are only coming to this human world for a visit (just wasting time).

And you will go to painful planes of existence if you die. You have debts (and) shouldn’t be in a relaxed mood. No contemplation of vedanā with insight that taṇhā and upādāna are storing the kammas. They release it one by one and do you have any freedom? Don’t be afraid of the results but the causes. 

Contemplate the impermanence of vedanā. If you not pay attention for them and it will do the connections. This is dhamma niyama – fixed order of the dhamma. Vedanā → taṇhā, upādāna and kamma → jāti continues. (mentioned about vedanā in the Sakka Pañha Sutta)

Contemplate the three feelings. If you not forget them and vedanā paccaya paññā – feeling conditions wisdom (with practice). And if you forget them, and vedanā paccaya taṇhā – feeling conditions craving. Forgetfulness is ignorance. If you are in a more relaxed way and it make more connections. 

The fault of heedlessness is very great indeed. Why it becomes vedanā nirodha taṇhā nirodho – with the cessation of feeling and craving also ceases? Because magga arises (path factors) and feeling ceases, so taṇhā can’t arise. You have no free time means connecting the D.A. processes. 

You are working for feelings that connecting with taṇhā and upādāna. The fault of no free time is very great indeed. The cessation of taṇhā means it’s not arising. Instead at the place of taṇhā, magga arises. Taṇhā, māna and diṭṭhi will cease (i.e., Nibbāna) if you can contemplate to the ending (or cessation) of vedanā.
