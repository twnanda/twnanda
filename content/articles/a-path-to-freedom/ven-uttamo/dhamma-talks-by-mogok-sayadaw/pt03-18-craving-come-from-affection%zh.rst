Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 6th March 1960

Touch your body. Is it warm or not? It's burning with the fire of decay (jarā). The body becomes mature because of it. A bamboo tree will fall after burning with more fire. In the same way the khandhas burning with more fire of decay becomes painful and sick. It's burning with the fire of sickness. You are sitting and can't keep your body still and changing from this side to that side. This is burning with sickness. If this body is with more burning just prepare to go to the cemetery. Oppress by these things all the time that it is the truth of suffering (dukkha sacca). These things are happening because of the 5-khandhas. It's the cause of suffering. This Dhamma is not the same as yesterday talk. Today I include the truth of Dhamma (sacca). Anyone who doesn't practice wanting to live with these suffering. When you are sick and unpleasant feeling arises; contemplate and it ceases. If you follow them to the end, it disappears, and then dukkha also disappears. The Buddha said that having the khandhas is having dukkha. So vedanās arise and follow them to the end; if vedanā ceases and then dukkha ceases. People want to free from sickness, but they don't do the work to free from it. So if you are healthy, contemplate it; and if not, also contemplate it. There was a discourse called Bojjhaṅga Sutta (Factors of enlightenment). When Buddhists are sick, they recite this one. Mahā-Moggallāna and Mahā-Kassapa were sick, so the Buddha taught them to recite the Bojjhaṅga. They did it what the Buddha said and cured their illnesses. 

You all are contemplating impermanence and developing the factors of enlightenment, but most of you is reciting it. These dhamma are for contemplation. In the Sutta it was said that bhāvita and bahulīkata. Bhāvita means contemplate, and bahulīkata means contemplating many times or developing. You could be NOT prevented by vedanā with contemplation when you are in good health. Whereas during being sick, it cures vedanā. It's like taking medicine. So contemplation is magga sacca and vedanā cured is nirodha sacca. Nibbāna is in this body. Don't go and search it anywhere. For example, you will never find it at Buddhagaya. (Then Sayadaw referred the story of Rohitassa Devaputta searching for the end of the world, AN.4.45 Rohitassasuttaṃ.) vedanāṁ khayo Bhikkhu Nibbānaṁ – Bhikkhu, the extinction of feeling is Nibbāna. Khandhas cease is also Nibbāna. Craving ceases is also Nibbāna. Don't afraid of old age, sickness and death but the affection of taṇhā. This is the most difficult thing. We are living with taṇhā in the whole round of existence. Practice insight into the affection things until disenchantment and no desire of them.
