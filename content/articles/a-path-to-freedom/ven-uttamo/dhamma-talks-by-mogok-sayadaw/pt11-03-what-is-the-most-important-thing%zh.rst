:summary: What is the Most Important Thing? (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 19th March 1961

[In this talk, Sayadaw used his own verses on the 4 Noble Truths to explain the practice. These verses are:

| ① Every formation is impermanent; remember as dukkha sacca. 
| ② Taking the impermanence as me; remember as the cause (samudaya) of affection 
| ③ The ending of all the mind and matter; remember their cessation as Nibbāna. 
| ④ The knowledge of the cessation; remember as the Path Knowledge]
| 

It’s important to know the truth. If you don’t know and it’s like a stick throwing up to the sky and falling down again in a random way. Your destination of rebirth is random and without stability. Therefore you have to practice and know the truth until your bones and skin are worn out.

At the time of encountering the sāsana and you must work hard. As the khandha is dukkha sacca and it needs to discern their oppressive nature. (pilantha). (continued the story of naked ascetic Kassapa). Avijjā – ignorance is not knowing the truth (told some stories of the people fell into hells, animal realms, etc). 

Now, you can smile and also have to cry in the future. The practice of satipatthāna is the task of knowing the truth. For knowing the truth, avijjā – ignorance must become vijjā  – knowledge. Only looking after the mind and body, when’ll you have the free time? It oppresses mercilessly to someone has affection for it. (It oppresses like the twin of blind and invalid babies i.e., body and mind to the mother). 

People didn’t have any affections were all in Nibbāna now. Except the task of becoming a noble person (ariya), all the other things are oppressing you. You must know that the khandha is the oppressive dukkha sacca. With more affection to it and more oppressive it’ll become. 

If you are treating it well and do you still have free time? You must see its oppressive nature with knowledge. Observe the 5 khandhas with the 5 path factors.

① Every formation is impermenent; remember as dukkha sacca. If you’re discerning the impermanence of conditioned dhamma and seeing dukkha sacca. Arising is dukkha. and vanishing is dukkha. In the khandha only the impermanence will arise. Paying more attention to discern impermanence than family and business matters. 

Because in the Saṁyutta Nikāya, the Buddha was urging as if we had the chance for listening the truth (for enlightenment), even we should accept the spear inflicted on us (Every day in the morning time 300 spears, in mid – day for 300 spears and in the evening for 300 spears, respectively. 

Even though we may die for once only. If we don’t know the truth will die for many lives to come. Also many uncountable sufferings are waiting for us, such as in hells, as animals, as hungry ghosts, etc). Seeing, hearing, smelling, etc. 

whatever arises and vanishes with change. With the blind and invalid (i.e., body and mind) combine together, seeing, hearing, smelling, etc are arising. After the arising and both are vanishing (mind and form). The mind is more quicker and the form a little slower. Because of the changing and vanishing that it is dukkha sacca. 

If you prefer kāya (form) and contemplate form. If you prefer mind and contemplate mind. Only you’ll see impermanence and end up with the knowing of dukkha sacca. Whatever you are contemplating only seeing impermanence, and knowing the truth (sacca).

② Taking the impermanence as me; remember as the cause of affection. If you not contemplate and become ditthi/tanhā and continue the saṁsāra. Beings are falling down randomly and it’s not good for happening. And it needs to abandon them. “I think therefore I am” is attaching to wrong views and arising everyday quite a lot. 

You have to do this task very quickly as going towards the cemetery. Because you’re going towards death (i.e., every second closer to death). The saying of you become older means it’s closer to the cemetery. ① is for contemplation (i.e., saṅkhāra dhamma, the 5 khandhas). ② is for abandoning (ditthi/tanhā). What is Nibbāna? With the contemplation of impermanence, it become mature and with a blip mind and body disappear (even if you’re contemplating the mind). This knowledge (ñāna) is in contemplating but under the knowledge these are disappeared.

③ The ending of all the mind and matter; remember their cessation, as Nibbāna. If you realize it and your destinations are becoming stable. (Will never fall back into the planes of misery). If you’re a tihetuka person (born with three wholesome roots of non – greed, non – hatred and non – delusion) ,and your practice is also right with viriya (right effort) will sure to realize it. 

Here only ① and ③ verses are important. It’s like you get the train ticket at Mandalay Railway station and arriving at Rangoon Railway Station (compared to the 1.and 3. verses). You’re passing through the knowledges between them. (From impermanence to Nibbāna. It’s also the same as from Mandalay to Rgn. will pass through other stations on the way.)

④ The knowledge of the cessation, remember as the Path Knowledge. After the lokuttara magga arises, ① and ② maggas cease (① is arising and ② is vanishing). After the Path Knowledge and Fruition Knowledge arises. And then you are becoming a sotāpanna. 

After the Path Knowledge ceases and the Fruition Knowledge arises is akāliko – non – temporal/immediate. (This point was not accepted by some scholars. But the yogis know what they are talking about).

Don’t lost these 4 verses. These are the processes of the practice. Don’t mix – up the vibrations of impermanence with me (self). If the hungry mind arises and don’t let it becomes I am hungry. Watch and observe, it’ll disappear.
If contemplating this way, do you still thinking as the saṅkhāra is me?

Wanting to sleep as me, wanting to eat also me and saṅkhāra will continue. Is it not terrible? Therefore before the contemplation, it’s important to dispel sassata and uccheda ditthi first. Are these saṅkhāra dhamma arising by you or by others? Or by you and others (both)? Not at all.

It arises by avijjā and saṅkhāra. After dispelling ditthi and practice with no. ①. And then no.③ will airse. Then you’ll get no.④.
