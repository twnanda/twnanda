Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 18th December 1960

The Buddha said, the five khandhas, wife, children and wealth were like the things in dreams. Dreams are not stable, if you wake up and can’t find it. The nature of the khandha is also last momentary. Wealth and belongings are also not stable. Again the khandha is also like borrowed things. It’ll return back to the owner. Aging and death will take back the khandha. 

Therefore the five khandhas have nothing of me and mine. Also you can’t find any of me and mine. If you can see it as arising momentarily and passing away, will know that it’s like a dream and borrowed things. Therefore, it never has stability and control. 

If you know this, taṇhā (craving), upādāna (clinging) and kamma (action) fall away. If you think the khandha has stability is like the foolish lion (The lion died by its shadow in the mirror.). We are taking the shadow of the khandha as stable. And also are thinking them as beings. 

You are making fortunes is like a blind man pouring water. However much you are searching for them can never fulfill it. The six senses-doors are like the six oceans. If you are filling them with taṇhā water can never fill it up. The ocean water still can be dried up, when doomsday arrives. 

Therefore, by filling the six senses-doors and you will never satisfy with it. For them in saṁsāra you were over tired. Not knowing is avijjā and filling with taṇhā water is saṅkhāra. You are wasting time with avijjā and saṅkhāra. 

If you have the six oceans and can never finish with it. Therefore, it’ll finish if you can make them disappear. So, you will arrive to happiness if khandha disappears. Filling the khandha ocean is like filling holes with a pot in it because it’ll never fill up. We don't know about the khandha with clinging and affection. By looking after it is like a blind man filling a vessel with holes. For the khandha to disappear must do vipassanā for seeing impermanence.
