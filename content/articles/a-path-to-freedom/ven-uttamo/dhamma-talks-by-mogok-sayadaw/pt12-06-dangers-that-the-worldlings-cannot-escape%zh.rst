Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; no date noted

The Buddha displeased with what the worldlings were thinking about. These are the thinking of the uneducated run-of-the-mill people. There are dangers caused by great fire, floods and insurgency which separate parents and children (For example, Japan Tsunami, Syrian War etc.). 

They’re worrying with these three dangers which can separate them. Anyhow with these matters, parents and children still can be reunited. The dangers worldlings can’t help or do anything to each other are; the danger of ageing. The mother can’t save her son. And also the son can’t save his mother, another danger is illness. 

After that comes the danger of death. These are the three dangers living beings can’t do anything about them. (These are from the Baya Sutta of the Aṅguttara Nikāya.) But the Buddha said that we could be saved from these dangers. Therefore, still we have hopes. (Buddhists are the most fortunate ones. There are no other teachings can help beings to overcome them except the Buddha Dhamma.)

Following the way or the path of no khandha we can escape from the dangers of ageing, sickness and death. If the parents have love and compassion to the children, vice versa must ask them to follow the maggan way (the Noble Eightfold Path)

The maggan arises by itself or by causes? It arises by causes. If you have the right attention towards its arising and maggan appears. With the objects of the five khandhas and the maggan can arise (the five khandhas are ārammaṇa and maggan is ārammaṇika). In the whole of saṁsāra we didn’t know the cause of maggan to arise. 

Therefore, in the whole of saṁsāra we were ending up with tear shedding shows. It’s important for me to show you the way; also importance for you to turn towards it. You will have a lot of tears to fall if you don’t do it well. In speech, mind and body are the five khandhas. In reality anicca dhamma exists. 

I have to show you, because it doesn’t exist or you don’t know about it? As long as you don’t know it, like the mother can’t save her son and the son can’t save his mother. You must turn your knowledge towards impermanence. All minds are anicca, dukkha and anattā. 

You have to know your mind arises and passes away. D.A. will continue if your knowledge comes in later. Don’t let other minds come in between the impermanence and magga. It doesn’t matter if it's separated between them with bhavaṅga cittas (life-continuum minds).
