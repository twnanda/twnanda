Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 25th February 1959

Taṇhā and altruistic joy (mudita) are similar in smiling nature. But their objects are not similar. Gladness for all is mudita. If only for someone is taṇhā. Mudita comes from mindful attention. Have gladness on everyone. Generally, if only for one person, then taṇhā comes in. With a determination whatever mind state arises, I’ll contemplate it. And then mostly you can do it. If taṇhā extincts kamma become fruitless. Blown away like a cotton wool. Taṇhā is clinging to the khandhas. Therefore, if you can contemplate the khandha as truth of dukkha, taṇhā will extinct.
