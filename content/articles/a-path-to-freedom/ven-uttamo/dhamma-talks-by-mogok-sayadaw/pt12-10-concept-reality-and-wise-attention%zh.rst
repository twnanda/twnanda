:summary: Concept, Reality and Wise Attention (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; no date noted

You have to remember, wise attention is important. You must expose the relity (paramattha dhamma). Because of the concepts, the dhamma to Nibbāna are hidden beneath the concepts. First, have to strip off the concepts. And must talk about dhamma to expose the reality. 

After uncovering the concept and the reality will appear. And then moving away the dhamma which covered up Nibbāna. Three kinds of dhamma are here. To discern anicca, dukkha, anattā and dukkha sacca, you must move away the hindrances. With only discovering of anicca, dukkha and anattā dhamma become wise attention. 

If you don’t have wise attention concepts will torment you. (Talked about Ven. Tissa who died and born as a louse. He had sīla but died with the attachment to his new robes). Mind and form, anicca, dukkha and anattā not appeared to him, and so he had unwise attention. 

Therefore he was born as a louse. In the world there are a lot of wrong attentions for us (Mentioned some of them in the daily life.). With wrong attentions beings are born in bad destination (dugati). Therefore beings were missing the chances with each Buddha. They’re living with things with wrong attention (family members, wealth, etc.). 

Wasting their time with things with wrong attention. They also not encounter with good teacher. And taking pleasures in things with wrong attention that they are arriving in woeful planes. A place not good to live is with a lot of fetters (samyojana). You have to work hard with the practice.

If become a habitual kamma and no need to be afraid of bad destination. (i.e., acinna kamma of regular practice) But with wrong attention becomes near death kamma (asanna kamma), and send beings to painful destinations. With right attention and right view, and with wrong attention and wrong view arise. With the teaching to expose the reality and will have the right attention. 

The things you can touch are not man or woman. These are just only form. It’s only the beginning for right attention. The things arising in you can’t be touch are mind dhamma. Only has these 2 kinds of dhamma. Can be measured is form and can’t be measured is mind. 

Want to eat, good to eat, etc. “Are these things can be measured?” (explained the 4 nāma dhama with examples) If you’re taking the medicine of truth and will be free from death. Only with the dāna, sīla and samatha practices are changing deaths. If you don’t start from the mind and body will not reach to right attention. 

If the mind abandons form and it’ll fall apart. You must remember mind is the leader. Mind is giving the order and form is following the orders. Only the foreman andworker exist. Now, we’re taking off the man and woman concepts. And diṭṭhi is cleared up. Without the heavy element of diṭṭhi will not fall into the apāya. 

We still have to uncover cause and effect process. This is to be freed from doubt (vicikiccha). Mind and body nature are changing and perishing. Except the impermanent process and nothing exists. With the right attention develops to the knowledge of rise andfall (udayabbaya ñāna)

If you prefer mind and contemplate the mind; if vedanā and contemplate vedanā. You’ll see the arising and passing away. Only the arising dukkha and the vanishing dukkha exist. At last you’ll make the decision that it hasn’t any sukha (happiness) but only dukkha (suffering). 

This is penetrating dukkha thoroughly. Only with the penetrating of dukkha thoroughly that substitute with nirodha – the cessation of dukkha.
