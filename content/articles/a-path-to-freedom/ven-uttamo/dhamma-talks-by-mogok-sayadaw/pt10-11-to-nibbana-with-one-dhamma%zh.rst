:summary: To Nibbāna with One Dhamma (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 11th January 1961

If you contemplate one dhamma and can finish the practice. For example, mind or feeling, if you can contemplate its impermanence and finish the practice. In the body a pleasant feeling arises and contemplate it as impermanence dhamma. Is it still a feeling or not? or the cessation of feeling?

It becomes vedana nirodha and tanhā nirodho – with the cessation of feeling andcraving also ceases. If you discern impermanence and craving dies away. If craving dies andarrives to Nibbāna. Nyan must see the cessation or vanishing. Seeing is magga. 

It becomes tanhā nirodho nibbānaṁ – the cessation of craving is Nibbāna. Not with many dhammas, but with only one dhamma will realize Nibbāna.

(We can see this answer in the Saṁyutta Nikāya, Kinsupama Sutta. The 4 arahants mentioned their respective practices; 6 ayatanas, 5 khandhas, 4 great elements and anicca. There were also many evidences from the 20th century living teachers of Burma. For example, Sun Loon Sayadaw, The – Inn Gu Sayadaw, We – bu Sayadaw, etc.)

The last arahant of the sutta mentioned only one dhamma, i.e., anicca. The 3 Burmese teachers mentioned only one dhamma, (i.e., ānāpāna). This is eko – dhammo – one dhamma. There are 3 kinds of feeling. By condensing them and become one (i.e., only feeling and only anicca). 

Pleasant, painful or neutral feelings (sukha, dukkha, and upekkha), whichever one arises contemplate to discern its impermanence. Pleasant, unpleasant metal feelings (somanassa, domanassa vedana) are also in the same way. Where these teaching came from?

(Sayadaw told the story of Kundalakesi. She was the only daughter of a rich man andfall in love with a criminal. Later married him and nearly escaped from his attempted murder. 

After became a female wanderer – paribbājaka and challenged everyone with her 1000 questions. Later met with Ven. Sariputta and couldn’t answer to his one question, “What’s the one Dhamma to Nibbāna?”.)

Ven. Sariputta questioned to her; “Answer me to Nibbāna with one dhamma?” She couldn’t answer it and Sariputta gave her the answer, “With the one dhamma of feeling can arrive to Nibbāna.” 

Therefore it needs only learn a system from a good teacher and practice. If you can contemplate rightly to see impermanence and sure to realize it. Nibbāna can’t be searched for. Only can discover it with contemplation. (e.g, see the Rohitassa devata’s story) If tanhā dies and Nibbāna. It’s quite easy.

(The Buddha’s Teachings were simple and profound. But with the practice it needs a lot of perseverance.No elaboration like the later Buddhist teachings.) 

(Sayadaw gave instruction on Vedananupassanā). If you contemplate the arising of feeling and at last only seeing impermanence. This is eko – dhammo – one dhamma. If it’s becoming anicca and magga; is there still has any kilesa comes in?” 

Later Kundalakesī became an arahant, and the monk surprised about it. Then the Buddha told them; “If you have a lot of knowledge and not practice for it become useless. Even with one dhamma and extinguish kilesa becomes precious.” 

If you only contemplate feelings and discern impermanence, its disenchantment and its ending will sure to reach Nibbāna. And then The Buddha said to the monks; “If you can conquer 100,000 enemies is not a hero. You can only conquer the kilesa enemy is a hero.”
