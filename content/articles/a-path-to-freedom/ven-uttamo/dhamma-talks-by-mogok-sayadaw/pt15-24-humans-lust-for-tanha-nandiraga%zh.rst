Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 7th July 1962

[It's quite a humorous talk with inspiration and encouragement and practice. It also shows Sayadaw’s instantaneous wisdom]

At the time of wise attention (yoniso), kilesa stops. (Sayadaw talks about Tevijja-vacchagotta sutta, Majjhima N. MN 71.) The Buddha knows everything by reviewing (paccavekkhana). Reviewing is the active mind (javana mind). The Buddha is a person with threefold true knowledge – tevijja. At the time of contemplation, the fetters – saṁyojana are cut off, and at this period one can attain Nibbāna. The fetters are not always present. They arise only when their causes are there. With the practice, we prevent the causes from arising. Someone who does not practice can’t achieve it. With the path factors (maggaṅga) arising, one is free from the fetters. Without practicing, defilements (kilesa) always remain latent (anusaya) in the mind. So don’t blame your lack of perfections (pāramitās). If you practice, it’ll be cut off (pointing to the D.A process chart). Ordinary disciples (sāvakas) who cut off the process will realize it. If consciousness, contact, feeling do not connect to taṇhā, then it’ll be finished. If the mind is showing anicca, follow behind with magga; feelings also follow the same way.

If you say we have a lot of saṁyojanas (fetters) it means – I don’t want to do it! (This is a common excuse most lay people give to the monks). Don’t ask for any boons. (i.e., by making merits and prayers). If you do it, you will get it. You have to take the practice as the main point. Also don’t worry about the result but be concerned about not doing it. (Sayadaw gave evidence by referring to the female boss Visākhā and Santati minister who were living family lives and attained realizations.) You don’t have to fear other things. Instead, you should fear Taṇhā! Why is that? Because it gives you Dukkha Sacca. You should be afraid of it coming to you. (Instead, humans have a strong lust for it, even worshipping it).

Everybody wants to know if I die where I will go? Don’t go and ask others but ask yourself (Our actions connect to taṇhā or not, as Sayadaw points to the D.A Chart). Sayadaw continued about the sutta. You can smile if your D.A process is cut off. If not, you’ll always be grimacing (as hell beings, animals, and ghosts). You all are like a vulture after eating dog flesh and smiling. (It’s a comparison for people who are smiling with family members and businesses).

Again, Sayadaw talks about smiles and grimaces from suttas and text stories, then gives an exhortation regarding near-death matters.
