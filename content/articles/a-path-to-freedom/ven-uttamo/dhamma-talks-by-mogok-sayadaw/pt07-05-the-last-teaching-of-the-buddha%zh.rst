:summary: The Last Teaching of the Buddha (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 3rd November 1961

According to the Buddha, the best way of worshipping to him was with Dhamma. It was not reciting Dhamma. By practicing Dhamma and the ending of dukkha was the realization of Nibbāna. This was the greatest worship. It’s also the same to a teacher. 

I am teaching to you with saṅkhāra dhamma. And you are also listening to me with saṅkhāra dhamma. (Sayadaw was using the last words of the Buddha to teach vipassanā). This physical body exists by kamma, mind, temperature and foods. It’s conditioned, so end up in ageing, sickness and death. This is referring to the relative truth (sammuti sacca). 

According to the ultimate reality, now in the khandha, dhammas are arising by conditions and seeing their impermanences. These are seeing with the 5 path factors. Vaya – dhammā saṅkhārā appamādena sampādetha – Saṅkhāra dhamma are have the nature of vanishing. Don’t be forgetful! After the Buddha had passed away, 

The following verses were recited by Sakka (King of the Tavatimsa Heaven): Aniccā vata sankhārā uppāda-vaya-dhammino; Uppajjitvā nirujjhanti, Tesaṁ vūpassamo sukho – Sankhārā dhamma are impermanent. The ending of them is Nibbāna. 

(In most of his talks, Sayadaw never translated the Pali, word by word. He took the main points for teaching. Here Sayadaw made a very important point of the last day of the Buddha. The Buddha reminded the monks on practice and Sakka pointed out the end of the practice, i.e. Nibbāna). 

Sakka was already a sotāpanna. So, he talked about followed to the end of the saṅkhāra dhamma. But most of you, after a person dies and say it’s saṅkhāra dhamma. So, it’s unstable and using it for reflection on death(maraṇanusati). 

The right place to use is in one’s own khandha. You have to use it for yourself when still alive. It is not for after death. At the end of saṅkhāra is Nibbāna exists (He explained the saṅkhāra dhamma had the nature of vanishing. By clapping 2 hands and sound arose and vanished.) In a being whole life and the whole of saṁsāra was with conditioning and vanishing. 

We are going like this without beginning and ending. In your daily life just searching and eating, searching and eating etc. and it will never end for the whole life. (It’s very important not to forget the true nature of dukkha; i.e. oppressive, conditioning, burning and changing. Need to reflect them very often with our own experiences in life. Then we can easily to let go of attachment.)

Explaining with the D.A process and it becomes more clearer. It’s not killing the past ignorance and volitional formation. But to kill what is arising in the present of ignorance and volitional formation which are arising by causes. Because of ignorance and volitional formation the 5 khandhas of dukkha sacca are arising all the times. 

A person contemplates impermanence is doing the work of abandoning avijjā and saṅkhāra. From ignorance and it becomes knowledge. Only ignorance arises that volitional formation comes into being. Vijjā (knowledge) is the contemplative right view of the path factor. 

The Buddha said not to be forgetful was reminding us to do vipassanā. Asking you for the practice is to make avijjā and saṅkhāra cease. Only with practice and reach our goals. When the path knowledge is reaching to the khandha and taṇhā also ceases. Without practice is except developing dukkha and no other thing. 

If you really look at this khandha, it doesn’t include any personal being nor an affectionate thing in it. You will only find out the arising and passing away of phenomena. Therefore the ending of impermanence is true happiness. 

The reason I am asking you; “Do you see the ending of impermanence?” This is asking you of seeing Nibbāna or not. Don’t ask me what is Nibbāna. It means doesn’t has this khandha. This khandha is dukkha sacca. Therefore you know it as doesn’t has one’s dukkha.

That’s the real happiness. Are you satify with Nibbāna exists at the end of impermanence? The Buddha and myself taught you to see impermanence, its disenchantment and its ending (i.e. Yathabhūta, NIbbida and Magga Ñāṇas) Dukkha covers up the process that can’t see Nirodha. 

Consume the 5 khandhas with the 5 magganga (path factors). After it becomes the 8 path factors and the consuming process is finished. At this place Nibbāna arises. You can’t see head, body, hands and feet. The two armed length body does not exist. At the place of 2 armed length body Nibbāna appears. Therefore dukkha sacca khandha covers up Nibbāna. 

Even a person can’t see impermanence is covering up with ignorance (i.e. ignorance or kilesa covers up impermanence or dukkha. Again dukkha covers up Nibbāna). Therefore wanting to become a sotāpanna it needs a teacher. I am giving you the way of removing ignorance. By listening the dhamma and know the way of uncovering. This duty is the teacher’s duty. 

To remove dukkha is your duty (i.e. following to the end of the process). Nibbāna is connecting with the 5 khandhas (i.e. close to the khandha).

The 5 khandha disappear and Nibbāna appears. Condense the whole teaching;the Buddha asked for practice to develop insight knowledge (i.e. the last verses of the Buddha). Sakka urged the yogis following it to the ending (i.e. Path knowledge). If you combine the verses of the Buddha and Sakka, they were only vipassanā knowledge and the Path knowledge.
