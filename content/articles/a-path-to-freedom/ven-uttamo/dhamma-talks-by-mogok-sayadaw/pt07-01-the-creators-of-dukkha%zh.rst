:summary: The Creators of Dukkha (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 21st October 1961

The Buddha said clearly that taints (āsava) were the dhamma oppressing living beings. Kāma-taṇhā is desire for sensual pleasure. Bhava-taṇhā is this life not good and desire for next life. Ditthāsava is not knowing the 5 khandhas and taking it as me and mine. Avijjāsava is not knowing the 4 Noble truths. 

These 4 murderers are the 4 āsava and killing living beings to become bones of mountain and fleshes of earth. Can it be oppressed to everyone? It can’t oppress to someone has the knowledge on the khandha. We should be very thankful for the Buddha’s attributes and service. With our own desire can’t do anything except only deaths. Our worshipping of the Buddha are not reaching to the ñāṇa Buddha and instead on the form Buddha. 

We don’t know the nature of the khandha and oppress by the āsava. We don’t let the ñāṇa knowing on the khandha existence that we are suffered up to their treatment. The Buddha said; “Someone knows (jhānato) and sees (passato) the khandha existence with knowledge (ñāṇa knowing) will free from the āsava.”

Āsava are making living beings whirling around and sinking in saṁsarā. Ānāsava (no taints) is Nibbāna. Seeing impermanence in the khandha and taint of ignorance (avijjāsava) becomes knowledge (vijjā). It’s not mine that becomes vanishing and taint of wrong view falls off. It has the nature of vanishing that no desire for it. And then taint of sensuality (kāmāsava) falls away. 

In this wayand the desire for becoming is also useless. Āsava is like a mother. Why the ñāṇa knowing not fits in with the khandha existence together? Because of unwise attention (ayonisomanasikāra) and falls into the province of āsava. With wise attention (yonisomanasikāra) ñāṇa knowing and khandha existence are fit in together. Without practice and āsava is unshakable.

The perception of man and woman disappear and khandha appears is the emptiness dhamma (suññāta dhamma). Knowing about the 5 khandhas is becoming a knowing person (jhānato). Let us contemplate it and becoming a seeing person (passato). It’s just knowing and not including seeing yet. 

Therefore have to contemplate at it for the knowing and seeing. By combining these 2 and āsava will cease. For e.g, seeing a white colour object. Knowing the white colour is the aggregate of consciousness (The 5 aggregates are working together. Here just talking about the knowing which is consciousness). 

Contemplate this knowing is passato. Contemplate as, it exists or not exists and you’ll not find it. It’s existing and not existing dhamma.

So, it’s arising and passing away.Note it with jhānato and contemplate with passato, and seeing the characteristics of impermanence, dukkha, anatta, asubha and the truth of dukkha. 

Is there any other thing exist? The 4 āsava cease and no khandha exists. Without the khandha and no death exists. No piles of bone, blood and flesh any more. Therefore with the way of jhānato and passato will be finished the PRACTICE.
