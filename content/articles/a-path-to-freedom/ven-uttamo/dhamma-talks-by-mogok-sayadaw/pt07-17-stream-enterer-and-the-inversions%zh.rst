:summary: Stream-Enterer and the Inversions (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 30th November 1961

By practicing vipassanā and realize Nibbāna is seeing the Deathless. There will be no more death again. At near death and oppress by painful feeling with intense practice will overcome it. At near death can’t rely on doctors. So, with right attention and practice regularly can work well at near death. 

Even dies with impermanence and next life will arrive to the Deathless (i.e. next life will become a sotāpanna as mentioned by the Budda.). Therefore it’s never in loss. What is the reason of unwise attention arises? Don’t have a good teacher. Parents are crazy. Therefore sons and daughters are also crazy. 

They teach them what they know only. Not find a teacher who can teach rightly and the dawn of light will not appear. And will be always in the darkness. All are born in the darkness and will die in the darkness. When the Buddha’s teachings are still existing and only rely on kamma alone is not much beneficial. Because it is not free from ignorance. 

We have to look for a teacher who can teach the truth. If you find a teacher who can teach the truth of dukkha and don’t want the truth of dukkha again. (Sayadaw explained the 12 inversions) After knowing these things with the contemplation and inversions become thin out. At the end of the contemplation, the stream entering of the Path Knowledge destroys 8 of them. 

Other Path Knowledges are not very important. The Path Knowledge destroy the 8 inversions is not an ordinary one. Becomes a non-returner 10 of the inversions are gone. Only an arahant destroys all of them. There are 3 paths exist; from blissful existence (sugati) to Nibbāna, from sugati to sugati and from sugati to painful existence (dugati). 

The crazy one doesn’t know how to go Nibbāna. Knowing about these things should come before. After that comes the contemplation. Later abandoning of them will come by itself. (Sayadaw gave some examples of the inversions in daily life). These distorted dhammas are making the D.A process to arise. 

If you can abandon them and D.A process is cutting off. After become a sotāpanna, in the future will free from becoming a disable, blind, deaf, dumb person and a leper. And also free from the wrong views and of falling into the 4 planes of misery. 

So, sotāpanna is abandoning these 10 kinds if dukkha. Ñāṇa falls in line with the khandha is right attention. Therefore we have to be practiced. 

The 8 inversions the Stream-Enterer has abandoned are; 

| ① view of permanence 
| ② view of happiness 
| ③ view of beauty 
| ④ view of self 
| ⑤ perception of (permanence) 
| ⑥ knowledge of permanence 
| ⑦ perception of self 
| ⑧ knowledge of self. 
| 

If you take what the khandhas are telling you in the opposite ways are inversions. If you take it as rightly is wise attention. If you see impermanence rightly and your craziness becomes better. In your every day life inversions are increasing. (Sayadaw gave some funny examples about them). 

These are showing the increasing of craziness. Your bones are becoming mature but not your knowledge (i.e. the age increasing but not the knowledge). If you observe the khandha with knowledge, it will tell you about impermanence dukkha, not – self and foulness (anicca, dukkha, anatta and asubha).
