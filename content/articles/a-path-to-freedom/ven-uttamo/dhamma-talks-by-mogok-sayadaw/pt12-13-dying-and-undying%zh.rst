Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; no date noted

Amatato – undying dhamma is Nibbāna. In the world there are 2 kinds of dhamma; dying and undying. It’s like there is heat and there is cold. The 5 khandhas are dying dhamma, and without is undying dhamma. Beings are going the wrong way that they have to die. If they are going the right way will arrive to the cool place. 

This place is not good and people are changing to other places. Wherever you’re changing just only changing death. With this khandha wherever you’re going will never free from dangers. Nibbāna is a safety place without the 11 kinds of fire for burning. So it has no aging, sickness and death. 

The khandha is the fuel for 11 kinds of fire. So you have to die again and again. (The eleven kinds of fire are; greed, anger, delusion, birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. It needs to be contemplated often with human life and see more clear.)

The 6 sense doors love sukha vedanā and beings are murdered by them. Therefore beings die by the killers of vedanā paccaya tanhā, upādāna and kamma. If you can make vedanā becomes ending will free from death. Beings swallow the poisons of vedanā with tanhā and kill by aging and death. If you know the khandha as poison tree and you don’t want it. (continued on Ven. Radha). 

Ven, Radha asked the Buddha; “Who is the murderer?” He asked about the king of the death. Here was maro. The Buddha answered as the 5 khandhas. Human never takes his khandha as a poison tree. All the 5 khandhas are poisons. If you observe one of the khandhas and will see its death with its own poison.
