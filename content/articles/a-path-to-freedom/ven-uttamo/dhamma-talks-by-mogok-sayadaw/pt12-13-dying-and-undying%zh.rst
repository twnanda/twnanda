Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; no date noted

Amatato – undying dhamma is Nibbāna. In the world there are two kinds of dhamma; dying and undying. It’s like there is heat and there is cold. The five khandhas are dying dhamma, and without is undying dhamma. Beings are going the wrong way that they have to die. If they are going the right way will arrive to the cool place. 

This place is not good and people are changing to other places. Wherever you’re changing it just only changes to death. With this khandha wherever you’re going will never free from dangers. Nibbāna is a safety place without the eleven kinds of fire for burning. So it has no ageing, sickness and death. 

The khandha is the fuel for eleven kinds of fire. So you have to die again and again. (The eleven kinds of fire are: greed, anger, delusion, birth, ageing, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. It needs to be contemplated often with human life and be seen more clearly.)

The six sense doors love sukha vedanā and beings are murdered by them. Therefore, beings die by the killers of vedanā paccaya taṇhā, upādāna and kamma. If you can make vedanā becomes ending will free from death. Beings swallow the poisons of vedanā with taṇhā and kill by ageing and death. If you know the khandha as poison tree and you don’t want it.

(Continued on Ven. Radha.) Ven. Radha asked the Buddha; “Who is the murderer?” He asked about the king of the death. Here was māra. The Buddha answered as the five khandhas. Human never takes his khandha as a poison tree. All the five khandhas are poisons. You will see its death with its own poison if you observe one of the khandhas.
