Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 3rd Oct. 1960

The khandhas have sub-moment arising (uppāda), sub-moment presence (ṭhiti) and sub-moment dissolution (bhaṅga). Nibbāna doesn't have these things, therefore, doesn’t have old age, sickness and death. Khandha is the real truth of dukkha. It was mentioned to the monks by Sāriputta near his parinibbāna (passing away). Khandhas were always burning with the fire of defilement. Therefore, in the whole of saṁsāra, I never had peace of mind. Carrying around these khandhas was heavier than Mount. Meru, because when the world ends it would be disappeared, but the khandhas would continue for existence. 

Therefore, for someone who enters into Nibbāna element (parinibbāna) will welcome it with gladness. The way of insight is watching the khandhas. You will see it as not there whatever is arising if you are watching it; because the knowing mind and the contemplative mind can't arise together. The arising is change (vipariṇāma) and not existing is perishing. Therefore, only exist as change and perishing. Change and perishing are the truth of dukkha – vipariṇāma lakkhaṇa dukkha saccaṁ. If you will follow the khandhas process, you only see the changing and perishing – ehi passiko. If you are seeing the change and perishing, it becomes the knowledge of seeing the truth. After seeing it for sometimes in this way, later it'll become NOT wanting to see it. This is the knowledge of disenchantment (Nibbidā Ñāṇa). Seeing the change and perishing is the knowledge of the way as it is (Yathābhūta Ñāṇa). If the knowledge of not wanting comes in, then the 5-khandhas disappear. This is leaving from the khandhas. If you ask, where it has gone? It's arriving to Nibbāna which is without khandhas. This point is very important. The nature of the khandhas are changing and perishing. If you are seeing these, then you get the yathābhūta ñāṇa. If you are continuing to contemplate and will become disenchantment with them. Yathābhūta means the right seeing. After becoming disenchantment don't get up and leave, but have to be continued with your contemplation.
