:summary: The Burden of The Khandhas (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 3rd Oct. 1960

The khandhas have sub-moment arising(uppāda), sub-moment presence(thiti) and sub-moment dissolution(bhaṅga). Nibbāna doesn’t have these things. Therefore, doesn’t has old age, sickness and death. Khandha is the real truth of dukkha. It was mentioned to the monks by Sāriputta near his parinibbāna (passing away). Khandhas were always burning with the fire of defilement. Therefore, in the whole of samsara, I never had peace of mind. Carrying around these khandhas was heavier than Mount. Meru, because when the world ends it would be disappeared, but the khandhas would continue for existence.

Therefore, for someone who enters into Nibbāna element (parinibbāna) will welcome it with gladness. The way of insight is watching the khandhas. Whatever is arising if you are watching and will see it as not there. Because the knowing mind and the contemplative mind can’t arise together. The arising is change (viparināma) and not existing is perishing. Therefore, only exist as change and perishing. Change and perishing are the truth of dukkha – viparināma lakkhanam dukkha saccam. If you will follow the khandhas process, you only see the changing and perishing – ehi passiko. If you are seeing the change and perishing, it becomes the knowledge of seeing the truth. After seeing it for sometimes in this way and later become don’t want to see it. This is the knowledge of disenchantment (Nibbidā Nyan). Seeing the change and perishing is the knowledge of the way as it is (Yathabuta Nyan). If the knowledge of not wanting comes in, then the 5-khandhas disappear. This is leaving from the khandhas. If you ask, where it has gone? It’s arriving to Nibbāna which is without khandhas. This point is very important. The nature of the khandhas are changing and perishing. If you are seeing these and get the yathabuta nyan. If you are continuing to contemplate and will become disenchantment with them. Yathabuta means the right seeing. After becoming disenchantment don’t get up and leave, but have to be continued with your contemplation.
