:summary: Taṇhā & Practice (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 

[In these talks we can feel the compassion of Sayadaw's. He pointed out the important of present situations for practice diligently to end dukkha. Not to waste the precious opportunity for ending dhkkha. Also he pointed out the great power of greed-craving (lobha-taṇhā) in daily life, people get lost in it and forget or can't give their time for the practice.]

Making the judgments are seemingly liked wisdom and opposing in doing the practice and goodness. Avarice (macchariya) and doubt (vicikicchā) can come in. It's difficult to know. It seems like wisdom (paññā). Making on the judgment for yes or no and at last can't do it. As example, for doing the practice on concerning one's health, and taṇhā come in and then can't do it. By making the judgment one can't do what should be done and then wasting the time. From the Buddha's point of view; quickly to do the holy practice and not to delay for it. True wisdom can succeed for what one desires (chanda)to do. Wisdom faculty (paññindriya) can conquer any opposition. Regarding with dāna, it's avarice; and for practice, it's taṇhā. True wisdom understanding the nature of not self (anatta) and do it without delay. Without practice is not difference from someone alive with the animal mind.

After seeing anicca by practice, the first vitthi-citta(consciousness in the cognitive process) gives the result of progress in business and wealth. At that time taṇhā comes in and can destroy the practice because the yogi takes it as busy in business. To realize Nibbāna the cognitive process of the knowledge of impermanence must arise continuously. Sensual pleasures of wealth and property are a kind of temptation (marā). For ordinary people there is no destruction of marā god (devaputta marā); but the marā of the mind can come in as a destruction. We exchange the invaluable Nibbānic happiness with ordinary happiness (This was the happiness of a dog for a bone; one of the similes of sensual pleasure by the Buddha.). It is quite a great loss. For doing dāna and making merits are also in the same way. Instead of giving support to Nibbāna let taṇhā leading us for wandering in the round of existence. Because of the good kammas of the past attained the precious human life, and met a good teacher, and hearing the Truth of Dhamma (Sacca). With practice can end dukkha, but most people misuse their past good kammas by wasting time in worldly sensual pleasures. 

(This Dhamma talk gives us a lot of good for thought and contemplation. The Buddha and teachers of Dhamma made the important points only. We need to gain more insight about them by reflection and contemplation. Seeing them more deeply, extensively and clearly. With these habitual practices can develop our wisdom faculties and development on the path.)
