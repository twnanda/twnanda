:summary: Insight Knowledge and Path Knowledge (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 15th October 1961

After the insight knowledges and the Path Knowledge will arise. Do the practice and will see it yourself. Seeing the mind arises and vanishes is insight knowledge. is observing by , and you’ll find its arising and vanishing (Here is phenomenon arises and, is the observing mind). The task to be carefully done is vipassanā practice. 

After the insight knowledge and the Path Knowledge arises. Do you have to expect for it? It happen to you without delay; anantara paccayo – proximity condition. The insight knowledge ceases and the Path Knowledge arises. If you ask in practice what have to be relied on? Don’t think anything. If you have insight knowledge is enough. 

If you get it and Path Knowledge arises by itself (Just continue to develop the insight knowledge). Getting the Path Knowledge is arriving to Nibbāna. The important thing to be hold on to is insight knowledge. If the insight knowledge becomes mature enough the Path Knowledge will arise by itself. During the practice don’t expect for it. Then taṇhā includes in it. 

If taṇhā comes in and the insight knowledge not comes to an end. And then can’t see Nibbāna. Your duty is following the impermanence. Anicca and magga, anicca and magga, etc… and follow like this. What is the benefit for it? Ignorance becomes thinning out and wrong view disappears. Taṇhā also dies. Ignorance, craving and wrong view are ceased. 

Insight knowledge is driving away these things. It’s eroding craving. Don’t ask how many times for doing the vipassanā magga. It depends on your kilesa thickness that vipassanā practice has to make it becomes thinning out. A person with thick kilesa has to take longer for it. Has to wash away one’s kilesa thickness with knowledge (ñāṇa). 

This is the answer you want. If your kilesa volume is little and become quicker. I have to remind you that don’t blame it on the perfection (pāramī). It take longer because of my few pāramī. Don’t give that kind of reason for it. 

The Buddha also taught that the insight knowledge ended and the Path Knowledge arose. I also taught it. Path knowledge still not arises is because of the kilesa volume not finish yet. Do not have doubt on what is happening. Kilesa not becomes thin out for the Path Knowledge to arise. Do not take it as, I have few pāramī and may be cannot get it in this life. 

If you are discerning impermanence the pāramī is completed. If your kilesa volume is thick and it take a bit longer. If it is small and it takes quicker. Have to be make decision in this way. Kilesa becomes thin and anicca becomes apparently clear. After that it abandons the process of the impermanence. You do not see it (i.e. impermanence). 

At that time Path Knowledge arises in a flash. In practice, this is making a decision for you. If Path Knowledge is still not arising and you have to stay with impermanence. After insight knowledge clears up all defilements and Path Knowledge has the chance to arise. And then you becomes a sotāpanna. 

In Saṃyutta Nikāya, the Buddha only taught 2 knowledges as, after insight knowledge and Path Knowledge arose. Whatever mind arises, observe and discern it not there. You get the insight knowledge. With ñāṇa discerns impermanence once and clears up defilement once. 

It is doing the job of making kilesa becomes thin. I have to talk about anantarapaccayo-proimity condition. In human world, a human being dies. After that the birth consciousness instantly arises in the heavenly world or hell. Is there any gap between them? This is anantarapaccayo (proximity condition).

After kilesa becomes thin out and insight knowledge ceases in a flash. It substitutes with Nibbāna, and you do not see impermanence. Instead only see Nibbāna. To get insight knowledge is our duty. Before, I am talking about Bhikkhu Sāti and have to show the process of the practice. If you die with insight knowledge and have to live one more life. 

The Buddha did not like it. Because birth is dukkha sacca. What you heard before was Nibbāna was very far away. You take it as will get it slowly. Do not believe in what people say. After insight knowledge is Path Knowledge. Believe in what the Buddha had taught. If you do it slowly by slowly and ñāṇa becomes blunt. Also kilesa will come in and take a long time. 

If you know your fault is on the right track and become right. Because you have to clean up your kilesa. (He continued to talk about Bhikkhu Sāti’s story. See the Mahātaṇhāsankhaya Sutta. Majjma Nikāya). Tongue consciousness is just eating. Knowing the taste of sweet, sour, bitter, etc. is mind consciousness (mana viññāṇaṁ). 

Eating consciousness arises on the tongue. Knowing consciousness arises in the heart. They arise at their own places. Eating consciousness arises on the tongue and vanishes there. It is not changing the place. Even consciousness arises in the khandha and can’t change places. Consciousness or the mind changes from one life to another life is very mistaken idea or view. For e.g, you put sugar into your ear. Does the ear tells you it is sweet?
  
Therefore mind arises at it own place and vanishes at the same place. One example the Buddha gave for the insight knowledge was like this. Getting up early, and looking at the direction of the sun rises. And you’ll see the red sky. If you ask why dawn arises? The answer is because the sun is nearly coming out. Here also why you see impermanence? The answer is the Path Knowledge nearly arising. 

If you see impermanence, āloko udapādi – will see the light arise. (from Khandhavagga Saṃyutta). Before you had done wrongs. Such actions are for the painful rebirths. It will be finished by correcting with insight knowledge. You don’t need to fear it. Insight knowledge for clearing up kilesa has to take a longer time. 

If you don’t see it anymore and its function is finished. With the Path Knowledge arises and you see Nibbāna. You don’t see it as like the round objects of sun and moon. You know that dukkha is ceased. This is NIBBĀNA.
