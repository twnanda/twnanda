:summary: Why Can’t Discern Dukkha? (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; no date noted

To know the present dukkha is important. First, to know the present dukkha, and the second become afraid of it are important. If you don’t afraid of the present dukkha, and will not afraid of the future dukkha. This khandha is present dukkha. 

If you only know aging and sickness, knowledge can’t arise. To know the dukkha of at the time of healthiness is important. Only that you know the real dukkha. If you know the dukkha of aging, sickness and death, is called saṁvega dukkha. With this kind of dukkha, the path (magga) not arises. 

To know the dukkha of when you’re healthy can lead to Path and Fruition Knowledges. Dukkha comes from groaning and crying can’t lead to magga. Knowing dukkha with the healthy body in activities can lead to the Path Knowledge. People were still healthy when they went to listen the Buddha’s teachings.

Dukkha with pain andaches are pathaka dukkha. Pathaka dukkha are distinctive dukkha. Even animals can know it. Dukkha arises at the time of healthiness can lead to the Path Knowledge. You can see this only with ñāṇa eye. And can’t see it with the ordinary eye. 

This is called apathaka dukkha. After getting old don’t practice and you’ll get only saṁvega (It means with old age difficult to do the practice). You can’t attain Path and Fruition Knowledges. Apathaka dukkha exists but not in a distinctive way. And observe with ñāṇa, you will know it as real dukkha. 

Pathaka dukkha is everyone can see. And apalhāka is not everyone can see it. People are practicing without samādhi that can’t see apathaka dukkha. 

(This point was the Buddha said to the monks). For 10 minutes or 15 minutes let the mind concentrates on the meditation object (here the breath). If the mind not running away is samādhi, but no penetration yet. It’s just only samādhi. 

Therefore if you all are arriving here, I am asking you to sit for samādhi 20 minutes or 30 minutes. (Sayadaw gave short instruction for ānāpāna samādhi. If someone went to his place and practiced for sometime, he asked to develop strong enough samādhi before vipassanā)

After developing calmness of samādhi and turning towards the khandha will see the apathaka dukkha. You’ll attain Path and Fruition Knowledges only with good health. And at near death you can’t and will only see pathaka dukkha (without the practice only see pains). 

The Buddha was asking us to practice when we were still young. At the time of the Buddha most people attained Path and Fruition Knowledges when they were healthy. Only few had realized it when they were sick. These people were also had previous experiences. After with calmness of samādhi you have to observe the 5 khandhas. Don’t observe all of them. 

The Buddha taught 4 satipatthāna. You have to look for the most attached object. Mostly attach to the mind with wrong view. (Sayadaw gave instruction for cittānupassanā) The saying of paramattha sabhāva means the ultimate phenomena have only intrinsic nature. Not as a body, 

For example, you see the itching and then it’s not existing. It’s intrinsic nature arises and vanishes. It’s ni – satta, ni – jiva – free from a person or a soul and you only see its intrinsic nature. We give the names just for knowing them, as examples, seeing mind, hearing mind, itchy mind, etc. (i.e., to know the arising object for contemplation).
