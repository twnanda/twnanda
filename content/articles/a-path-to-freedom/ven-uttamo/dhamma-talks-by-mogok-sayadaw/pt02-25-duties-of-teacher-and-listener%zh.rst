Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 20th March 1959

A teacher of the Dhamma can teach to the points for disenchantment to the khandhas with letting go and abandoning the khandhas is called Dhamma Teacher (Dhammakathika). He must teach his disciples whatever phenomena arising from their khandhas to the points of becoming disenchantment to them, letting go and ending of them. From the point of listeners, it should not only become just a good talk for listening, but with the desire for practice to end dukkha.
 From your part if you can take one of the phenomena (4-satapathams) and practice become disenchantment, letting go and ending, then it’s the right practice. If you are fulfilling these points you will realize Nibbāna in this life as mentioned by the Buddha in Saṃyutta Nikāya. Here the Buddha did not mention about pāramīs. Is it possible? Don’t let this kind of doubt come in. When it comes in, and then becomes a hindrance for the path and fruit (magga and phala). 

(Sayadaw gave an instruction for citta vipassanā) Every mind arising and you know it and will find out that they are making a blip, blip and die out all the times. Therefore, the Buddha was warning us looking for the deathless. If you found out all these deaths become disenchantment to them. Whatever is arising pay attention and observe will discern all these deaths. From the 6-sense doors each moment only one can appear. You are not disenchanting yourself because you don’t see your own death yet. When you are in someone’s funeral, and can talk about business matters and other things, because it’s not your own death. 

Therefore you must look at your own deaths. Seeing other people funerals are not disenchantment and just afraid for dying. I had done my 3 duties (as mentioned in the beginning). From your part, practice according to the dhamma (Dhammānu dhammappaṭipatti). Dhamma is the arising dhammas which are the object of contemplation. Anupaṭipatti is contemplative knowledge which is practicing according to the dhamma. Dhamma shows its impermanence and just knows impermanence. In this way become dhammānu dhammappaṭipatti.
