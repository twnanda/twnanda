:summary: The Extension of Saṁsara (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 15th May 1962

[Taṇhā, māna and diṭṭhi are the dhammas extend the saṁsāra (round of existence). The Noble Eightfold Path is the dhamma cutting off saṁsāra. The QandA between, Ven. Mahākotthita and Ven. Sāriputta were about these dhammas. Mahākotthita asked questions and Sāriputta answered them. 

| 1. Q: After the 6 āyatanas (6 sense bases) cease, something still has come to be? (i.e. asking with sassata diṭṭhi) 
| A: Don’t ask in this way. 
| 
| 2. Q: After the 6 āyatanas cease, something not come to be? (asking with uccheda diṭṭhi) 
| A: Don’t ask in this way. 
| 
| Q3 and 4 were asking with the wrong views of ekacca sassata diṭṭhi and amaravikkhepa diṭṭhi. 
| The answers were in the same way. 
| 

Sayadaw said, these were concerning about the nāma/ rūpa process. He used cittānupassanā to explain them. After the mind ceases and Nibbāna appears, Therefore, after 6 āyatanas cease is Nibbāna. Mahākotthita was asking as something happened mean as a being or papanca (i.e. taṇhā, mānaand diṭṭhi). After papanca ceased ni-papanca arises (without papanca is Nibbāna). 

Sayadaw gave a very simple vipassanā instruction. Whatever mind arises observe its anicca. Observe ① with ②; ①. Is the arising dhamma and ②. Is the observing mind. And will see impermanence. Two minds can’t arise together. of the 6 āyatanas, mind base (manāyatana) is where papanca dhammas arise.]

In the khandha there are 2 kinds of dhamma. Dhammas extend dukkha and not extend dukkha. A person knows this khandha as dukkha will not extend dukkha. Dukkha with dukkha connecting and continuing is papanca dhamma. Death connects with birth both of them are dukkha (cutijati). Dhamma not extend dukkha are ni-papanea dhamma (without papanca). 

If you want to end dukkha have to practice and stop papanca dhamma to arise. All of you have a lot of extension of dhamma. To abandon them you need the help of a teacher. And you must also practice hard. The extension of dhamma are taṇhā, māna and diṭṭhi. 

The non – extension of dhamma are the path factors. Both of them arise from the heart. Dhamma abandoning them only exist in the Buddha Teachings. The extension of dhamma exists all the time. (All other systems and knowledges exist outside the teachings). What extend them and have to be abandoned? This question arises. (Sayadaw told the QandA between Ven. Mahākotthita and Ven. Sāriputta)

If the āyatanas are ceased; are there still other kilesas arise? The answer will be not in this way. Cakkhāyatana (eye-base) to kayāyatana (bodily – base) are the 5 form bases (eye, ear, nose, tongue and body). Manāyatana (mind-base) is only one. Adding them become 6-sense-bases. After they are ceased, other kilesa still arise? Or Is there anything exists? 

Don’t ask in this way. At the place of cessation Nibbāna must appear. With these 6 āyatanas dhamma can arrive to Nibbāna. Ven. Sāriputta talked about the contemplation of impermanence of the 6 āyatanas. It included both body contemplation and mind. 

So, all the minds cease nothing arise and only Nibbāna appears. This is not a person nor a being. So, you didn’t need to ask; isn’t something arising? There is no papanca and it’s the same asking as; is there any papanca? If papanca ceases and Nibbāna appears. Don’t have any doubt about it. Someone still not ending yet has to follow to the end.

All the 4 Qs were asking with wrong views. Both arahats were making the decision for us. If papanca ceases and it’s Nibbāna. And if not ceases and khandha will arise. Wanting to end dukkha, you have to kill the cause of papanca. It’s the mind or the mind-base. (Sayadaw continued to teach cittānupassanā). 

Mind is viññāṇakkhandha. Contemplate ① with ②. Every time ① arises and contemplate with ②. You know it as not there. ① arises and follow with ②, and papanca will cease. For example, the mind of wanting to eat something arises and you contemplate after and it’s there or not? 

Two minds can’t arise in parallel. Pre-mind ceases and the post-mind can arise. The arising mind is ①. And the not existing of the mind is ②. Follows ① with ②. is enough. (Only the arising mind disappears and the observing mind can take it place. 

So, the observing mind seeing it as not there. This is seeing emptiness. The pre-mind arises and follows with the post-mind. Then papanca disappears without arising. Give an e.g, in the snake area you keep a mongoose and snakes disappear without coming. 

Therefore, it abandons pananca is clear. (Sayadaw continued to explain the insight process of seeing impermanence, its disenchantment and its ending). Don’t be afraid of birth (jati), but to the papanca dhamma. Because birth is the result and pananca is the cause of it. Dukkha disappears and sukha arises. Light appears and darkness disappears.
