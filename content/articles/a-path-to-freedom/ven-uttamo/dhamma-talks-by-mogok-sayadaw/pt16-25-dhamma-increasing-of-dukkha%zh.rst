Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 7th August 1961

Dhamma increasing one's dukkha are wrong perception, wrong knowing, and wrong viewing of things.

① With wrong perception taṇhā/diṭṭhi arises →

② With wrong knowing leads to wrong clinging/diṭṭhupādāna →

③ With wrong action → wrong attaining, it becomes dukkha sacca. So a wrong perception connects two lives. Each day, how many perceptions of son, daughter, husband, and wife arise? They are uncountable. The diṭṭhi that controls the arising of kammas is also uncountable, as are the seeds to apāyas. You have come to this human world for a visit, and after death you will go to apāyas. All these wrong things must be contemplated forcefully with insight knowledge. You have to practice like rubbing two pieces of bamboo until fire comes out. Your wrongness is so strong and higher than Mount Meru. You have to look after your health while practicing with effort. The Buddha himself mentioned that with good health one would achieve it. Right perception → right knowing → right clinging → right effort 

If you separate the five khandhas with the satipaṭṭhāna, you will get four of them. Whatever it may be, at last, it goes into the truth. Whatever khandha or satipaṭṭhāna you observe, you only discern anicca. Anicca is dukkha sacca. All the five khandhas are inside dukkha sacca. Anicca, dukkha, and anatta are teaching people accordingly. In reality, it’s only dukkha sacca.
