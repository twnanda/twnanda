:summary: Why So Many Corpses? (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 29th December 1961

I am old now. I’ll die very soon. Think yourself with these things. Where are aging and death coming from? It is from birth (jati). Aging and death are dukkha sacca – the result. Birth is samudaya sacca – the cause. 

Thinking about the khandha and these things appear. Then you know about truths (sacca). Again where is jati coming from? From kamma – bhava – the producing of kamma for becoming. Kammabhava is the cause – samudaya. And jati is the result – dukkha.

If both of them cease and become nirodha sacca. The practice of their cessation is magga sacca. Therefore you have to practice magga sacca. Thinking in this way is knowing about the truths. You’re afraid of kamma (here, black or unwholesome ones). 

Why is that? Because it makes jati – birth (painful births). It makes dukkha sacca. But also you’re expecting good kamma (for blissful rebirths and enjoying the fruits). This also will give you dukkha sacca. By thinking backwardly (the reverse order – patiloma of D.A. process) and will find the 5 khandhas as the cause. 

Because of the 5 khandhas that tanhā arises. From the khandha and tanhā arises is not knowing about it. This is not knowing it as the 5 khandhas (with ignorance and have ditthi/tanhā). The Buddha said that tanhā came from upadhi (acquisition); it means khandha.

With affection to one’s own khandha and others’ khandhas that tanhā arises. If you have affection to the khandha means you want to die. (According to the D.A. process; section② → section③ → section④ = the 5 khanda → tanhā, upādānā, kamma → jāra, marana). 

Whatever khandha you have affection is wanting to die. With the affection to the khandha, wherever you’ll be had to die. All your corpses were piling up (like mountains). Don’t say that it’s kamma. It’s the cause of affection to the khandha (tanhā). Affection means foolishness for deaths. The D.A. process is telling you that because of affection and you have to die. 

Khandha is section ②, affection is sec.③ and death is sec.④. Having to die again and again are tormenting by affection. In the many kinds of death which one do you like? (Sayadaw mentioned some of them) If you contemplate the impermanence of your khandha and no affection for it. No affection is magga. It’s non – greed (alobha). This khandha is like a liquor mixed with poison. If you drink it and have to die.

In the same way if you have affection to the khandha and also have to die. The poisonous liquor is like the khandha (In one of the sutta, the Buddha compared it with the 4 poisonous snakes). The foolish worldling is the person clinging to it. The one who drinks the poisonous liquor. If you contemplate the impermanence of the khandha and no affection arises. If you are without affection for it and will not die again.
