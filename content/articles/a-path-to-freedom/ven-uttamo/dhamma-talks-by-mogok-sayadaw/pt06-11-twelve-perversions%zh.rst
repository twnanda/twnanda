:summary: Twelve Perversions (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 3rd & 4th August 1961

[There are 12 perversions (vipallāsas): i.e, 3 wrong attitudes to the 4 subjects (3x4=12); 3 wrong attitudes are: wrong perception, wrong knowing & wrong viewing. The 4 subjects are: Taking impermanence (anicca) as to be permanence (nicca), suffering (dukkha) as happiness (sukha), not-self (anatta) as self (atta), & foulness (asubha) as beauty (subha); ]

Without knowing the mistakes we are constructing perversive walls again & again & it become taller & darker. The Buddha gave an example of throwing a pebble upwardly to the sky & it stays a moment in the mid air & then falls down again. 

In the same way living beings come to this human world for a short moment like the pebble in the mid air. But falling into the planes of misery are longer like the pebble staying on the ground. Your business and wealth are becoming useless after you die. 

Everyday you have to make adjustment to the khandha & request for long life. Using foods, medicines & other things, etc. We get the khandha for making these 3 mistakes. If you transend them all & become an arahant. If you can eradicate the 3rd mistake will get the first Nibbāna. (i.e ditthi vipallāsa).

If you can overcome the 1st mistake (i.e, saññā vipallasa) will become sakadagamin & anagamin. Overcome the 2nd mistake (i.e, citta vipallāsa) become an arahant. The first Path Knowledge eradicated 8 factors of perversion (i.e, view of permanence, view of happiness, view of beauty, view of self, perception of permanence, knowing of permanence, perception of self & knowing of self). 

The 2nd & 3rd Path Knowledges eradicated 2 factors And the 4th Path Knowledge eradicated 2 factors. Without eradicated wrong view can’t get the first Nibbāna. Without eradicated wrong perception can’t get the 2nd & 3rd Nibbāna. Without eradicated beauty & happiness (subha & sukha can’t realize the 4th Nibbāna. (From the Aṅguttara Nikāya). 

I’ll explain about the practice. In your khandha originally exists is impermanence, suffering, not-self & foulness. To these 4 subjects multiply with wrong perception, wrong knowing & wrong viewing factors & become 12 perversions. 

These dhammas are happening uncountable in everyday life. Kamma can’t send you to Nibbāna but Nyan can. There is no good kamma directly to Nibbāna, but with good nyan will get it. There were many Buddhas had arisen uncountable in the world. But living beings were for many lives surrounded themselves with many walls of perversions that Buddhas couldn’t enter to them. And light of Dhamma couldn’t enter through them. 

Jhanas, Path and Fruition Knowledges are can’t be attained by practicing with dāna, sila and prayer. And only with direct practice of samatha and vipassanā. With direct practice and still can’t get Nibbāna, then your kilesas are thick. 

Do not express it to people. If you do it then no shame about it. So, just only try harder. And do not complain of wrong view. So, I will talk about it first. By talking before about perversions of perception and knowing, it misses the target.

(Recounted the story of Subrahma Devata) 500 celestial nymphs were died instantly and fell into the hell. This was because of without eradicated wrong view and the seeds of hell were with them in the heaven. Destructive kamma (upaghataka kamma) came in and struck them and fell into hell, even their lives span were not finished yet.

(This point is interesting because most of us may be thought, as a deveta can be lived for its life span. They did not have chances for developing good kamma there and only for enjoyments. 

So saṁsāra is not good and very dangerous.)The Buddha could not save them directly but instead could stop it by giving the way of practice (To the other 500 celestial nymphs and Subrahma Devata).
