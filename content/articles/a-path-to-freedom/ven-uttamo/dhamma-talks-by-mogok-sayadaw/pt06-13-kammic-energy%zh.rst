Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 5th August 1961

The root of the dangers of ageing, sickness and death are the 12 inversions. These arise by not knowing the true nature of the khandha. Where are the inversions coming from? These come from perceiving, knowing and viewing wrongly of the khandha. 

These arise to a worldling who doesn’t has any knowledge about them (asutava puthujjana). A disciple of a noble one has knowledge about them and doesn’t has it (sutava ariya savako). Therefore approaching the virtuous and wise people are very important.

If you want a good death must have a good living. To have a good living have to fix with the ariyan eyes. Among the inversions; perception (saññā) knowing (citta) and view (diṭṭhi); perception of inversion is the sharpest one. After it follow by citta and diṭṭhi vipallāsas. 

Someone without a clothes is seeing as a crazy person. But you don’t know yourself as a crazy person with clothes. The differences between them are a naked lunatic and a well clothed lunatic only. Nibbāna not accepts the crazy people.

There are 62 types of wrong view (During the Buddha’s time). But if free from sassata and uccheda views and then all wrong views are clearing away. After death consciousness and arises birth consciousness. Does the kamma not ceases and becomes birth consciousness? If the kamma is not ceasing and not dies and doing the job, then become the view of eternalism (sassata). 

The Buddha had 2 ways of teaching, direct and indirect ways. He does it so he receives it. This is indirect way (as e.g, kamma follows like a shadow). It seems the kamma is not vanishing and going directly and doing the function. You all have this view. (Most Buddhists have this view on kamma). With this view in your mind and practice can’t realize Nibbāna. 

It hinders by the view of eternalism. The Buddha taught by examples and the listeners took it directly. During the kamma functioning, kamma is volition (cetana) or mind and like a foreman. And the body is like a worker. The mind gives order and the body acts. After function together and mind/body cease (i.e. vanishing) 

Then why the Buddha taught kamma paccaya jati? – Action conditions birth. Here the cause is continuing. Even though the mind/body cease and the kammic energy left behind (Modern Science knows this). This kammic energy functions it.

If you take the kamma (volition) as impermanence and can’t follow to somewhere and you are free from the view of eternalism. In the whole country majority of people taking kamma as eternal. The Buddha said that only cause and effect connection and not the connection of entity (or identity). 

The view of changing life to life (reincarnation), the soul or life (jiva) goes out (i.e. a being dies) are views of eternalism. Most Buddhists have these views. (The mistaken ideas and views arise by not knowing the Sutta teachings and no teacher explains properly. And also later Buddhists develop it by thought games).
