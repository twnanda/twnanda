Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 26th November 1961

If there is no cessation of avijjā and no cessation of Dukkha (It’s true according to the 12 links of D.A. process. In the practice and experience of Thai forest teachers, they also mention finding where ignorance (avijjā) hides and destroying it in the final stage, the fourth stage or Arahantship. In everyday life samudaya arises from dukkha. (See. D.A. Chart, section two → section 3) In everyday the circle of D.A. arises again and again. It was like a cow circling an oil producing circular grind stone. What it means saṁsāra is long? Is it in a straight line or running in circular? It’s running in circles. Dukkha is wood (fuel) and samudaya is fire. Fire and fuel are turning circular. If you apply a number to them it will also never end. [It starts from avijjā to the end, and then from the end to the beginning (i.e., anuloma  paṭiloma).] Again and again of ageing, sickness and death is ignorance (avijjā). This is the worst situation of a person with no cessation of ignorance. In the era of short human lifespan even people are still making themselves become stupid and foolish (instead of wise— i.e., follow the Dhamma practice). (Sayadaw compared the human life span with the Tāvatiṁsa Heaven life span. 100 human years = 1 day of Tāvatiṁsa, at one day one of Sakka’s wives passed away from there and born in human world. She made merits and prayers to be born again as Sakka’s wife. When she was born there Sakka’ and devatās were still playing in the garden.)

Humans are doing all kinds of unwholesome dhammas. They are playing stupid shows even among the sufferings (no limits in stupidity) (If we look at the human world today and contemplate with D.A. process can discern many kinds of stupidity and foolishness about humans-it’s quite a mess and chaotic.) You have to make this determination— “Let me starve and die, I have to finish my vipassanā task” You have to make great effort as this is to be your last life. Starving to death is not so important.

Only fearful to be fallen into hell or apāyas. Which one do you like-after starving to death and not falling into hell or apāyas OR die with a full stomach and falling into hell? (This question should be asked to politicians, economists and billionaires). The Buddha himself said that— “If I tell you about the sufferings of apāya dukkha it’ll never end.” Don’t take the Buddha’s warning superficially, this is very great and extensive suffering (Dukkhas). Let’s do the practice.

I’ll extract the Pāli Dhamma from the Saṃyutta N. A monk asked the Buddha as— “How can a person knows, contemplates and sees with the cessation of ignorance and becoming knowledge?” Because of the past ignorance you have to pay your kammic debt with the khandha. It’s important that from this khandha not let ignorance arise (i.e., from sec. 2 not arise sec. 3, see the D.A. chart). You have to contemplate the anicca of ārammaṇa and dvāra (sense object and sense base), contemplate the anicca of minds. And you’ll see anicca dukkha sacca. (Sayadaw gave instruction on the contemplation of mind which was Sayadaw’s favorite) In this way from sec.2, sec.3 did not arise. Avijjā is not born out from the khandha by discerning anicca dukkha sacca. Not having it taṇhā, upādāna and kamma do not arise. If contemplate all the arising mind and ignorance ceases. It’s doing the work of knowledge. Vajjā is magga (knowledge). If you discern anicca and see Dukkha.

Also contemplate the anicca of feelings (here taught vedanā). Sec.3 does not arise that does not connect to sec.4 (i.e., birth— jāti). No birth is Nibbāna. At first you contemplate it with the knowing— knowledge from my teaching. When you see it directly, ignorance will cease. Ignorance is born from sec.2 and if doing vipassanā sec.3 does not arise. (see the 12 links of D.A). In this way the play of life ended in sec.2. The play of life now will end. Section two is Dukkha Sacca, and when contemplating it one knows one’s own Dukkha. Not knowing about the attaining of Dukkha and it becomes ignorance. Knowing the arising Dukkha and it becomes vijjā. You’re discerning anicca dukkha that becomes the disciple who follows the Buddha’s exhortation (ovāda). You’re free from Doubt and have the quality of bravery. And not believing it from what others have said. You become a sāsana person (a true Buddhist or sotāpanna) (Here the important point is still not becoming a sotāpanna is an outsider) In the teaching given to Saccaka wanderer— it’s important to see it by oneself. It doesn’t need perfection (pāramīta). You take note of it carefully and contemplate anicca for not letting ignorance arise.

(The main differences between Buddhism and other faiths are-Direct seeing or understanding; believing in what others said or ignorance.)
