Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 13th March 1962

The questions and answers between Mahākoṭṭhika and Sāriputta was for the future generations of people to learn from them and for the practice. They have finished their tasks already that no need to or no reason to ask these questions for themselves. People listening to this take must note down the way of the process and have to practise. The worldling who arrives at the height has the habit of running towards low direction. If you imitate the low people or the lowly things will fall down. Therefore, you have to imitate the upwards things and people. (This talk given to the couple who were very close disciples— U Chie Swe and Daw Ma Ma at their home. Many talks gave them personally were only 30 minutes long or short talks)

Today I’ll talk about disease (rogato, roga). You’ll know it by observing. Sitting too long makes the body become tired. This is the khandha showing it to you. It has disease so that disease arising. You see dukkha sacca. If the khandha is itching and disease arises. The khandha is showing you dukkha sacca. It’s showing you what originally it has. If you don’t believe it you pull each one of your head hair and will see painful (Buddha-dhamma is very practical and not talking about superstition and supernatural like belief in God who no one has seen before)

These are diseases. If you see disease, it is seeing dukkha sacca. You have to contemplate is as— , etc. No contemplation, it is followed behind dukkha with domanassa. Worry and sorrow will follow you as— Could I cross over the Dukkha mountain? If disease arises, one will fall into apaya. Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, etc., follows people who don’t know about them. This will happen to you and others (i.e., family members). It’s more painful by falling into apāyas with over concerns (It’s like the modern love song-I love you more than I can say— just rubbish! Even if you don’t love your parents who give you life. It’s just cheating and lying to each other like politicians). Khandha shows dukkha sacca without realizing that both of them have fallen into apāyas.

If you want the disease (rogas) to go away, first understand the disease and lose interest in it. Therefore, at first practise to know about roga, and then follow with disenchanting and ending of it, will arrive at Security— Khema of Disease. If not it’s just only empty concerns and by accepting it falls to apāyas. If you want to end your disease, you can't be concerned for others and also can’t keep quiet. You have to discern about the disease. Having a good sleep also causes disease. Why? -because of sloth and torpor which is an unwholesome mind. Changing the body this way and that way is also roga. Keeping this thing and that thing is also roga, etc. (There are many things to mention about them.)
