Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 16th November 1961

Your life span is after a mind arises and passes away and next mind not arises is dead. The Buddha was reminding us for many times as living with mindfulness and wisdom (sati and paññā). Mindfulness is be aware of what happening in the body. 

Every time the body is talking to you must aware of it. Wisdom is making a decision on the arising phenomenon as what it will be? Be mindful and making a decision with paññā. A person with mindfulness knows a mind arises and passes away one by one in a series. 

What happening is one’s own dying. Not do this practice and don’t know the body becomes old. And also don’t know the disintegration of it. Don’t know these things are without looking at it with mindfulness and wisdom. Not knowing is ignorance. Ignorant person will do and say what he wants. 

In that way is turning towards avijjā paccaya saṅkhāra – ignorance conditions volitional formation. And then end up with ageing, sickness and death. Observe with mindfulness and wisdom, then ignorance ceases and becomes vijjā udapādi-knowledge arises. Will not encounter with ageing, sickness and death. 

This is a very important matter. Therefore always mindful in the body and making decision with paññā. For e.g. an itch arises in the body. Itching is dukkha and after vanishing is sukha (unpleasant and pleasant). Pain is dukkha and its disappearing is sukhā. In our bodies feelings are changing. 

Does the body tells you man or woman, a person or a being? or it telling you feelings are changing? These are aggregate of feeling (vedanakkhandha), and not a person nor a being. So during the contemplation man or woman disappears in the body. From the young age parents taught us these were men or women all the times (with concepts). So we are clinging to a person or a being (Here I summarize what Sayadaw had said in his talk.)

Therefore feeling, and khandha disappear because of the concepts. They taught us the conventional truth. Therefore I have to teach you the ultimate truth (paramattha sacca). They were also right as concepts. It’s not truth because not really exist. 

Be mindful and observe with paññā, and 3 types of feeling are arising in turn (i.e. sukha, dukkha and upekkha vedanas). This is seeing the existing phenomenon,and knowing the ultimate truth. Before we are ending up

at with conventional truth. So you all are alive with the changing of feelings. There are feelings all the time. If you are using a needle poking on the body and there are no places free from feeling. Because it’s vedanakkhandha. I am analyzing it how to be mindful and observe with paññā. (Sayadaw gave many examples for the 3 physical feelings, i.e. sukha,dukkha, and upekkha in daily life). 

Why I am talking so detail about it? I am concerning with the wrong view of why it happens to be like this come into your mind. (He also mentioned about mental feelings with e.g.) 

Therefore at anytime we are never free from feelings. Every time feeling arises must know it. Every time feeling arises and observe with mindfulness and wrong view dies. These are aggregate of feeling, not a man nor a woman. After with mindfulness and decide with paññā. Only with paññā you get the knowledge. 

Every time feeling arises and knowing is mindfulness. Sukha vedana is passing away. Dukkha vedana is passing away. And upekkha vedana is passing away. Making these decision are paññā. Then it become insight knowledges. Paññā is making the decision of one by one vanishing. Mindfulness is seeing the arising proess. The Life span of feeling is now arising and now vanishing. 

Therefore it’s too short of life span. It has the life span of moment arising and moment vanishing. Be mindful and observe with wisdom and seeing impermanence. To get the Path Knowledge you have to do like this. Praying for the Path Knowledge is not only you can’t get it, but also craving arises. It’s because of the desire. By contemplation only get the insight knowledge. 

Be mindful and observe with paññā. The things you can ask is ageing, sickness and death. Contemplation without asking is ending the ageing, sickness and death. There are 5 path factors in sati and paññā. (3 samadhi factors with 2 wisdom factors). These 5 path factors are cutting off kilesa and leading to NIBBĀNA.
