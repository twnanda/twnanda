Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 8th December 1960 

[Sayadaw based this talk from Samiddhi Sutta, Devatā samyutta. Bhikkhu Samiddhi was handsome & lovely. A femal earth-deity (bhumma devatā) saw him in the light of early dawn fell in love with him & planned to seduce him. Samiddhi insisted that he would not abandon the monk`s life for the sake of sensual enjoyment. He explained to her, “The Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasure are time-consuming, full of sufferings, full of despair, & the danger in them is still greater, while this Dhamma is directly visible, immediate (akāliko), inviting one to come & see, applicable, to be personally experience by the wise.” (The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed one + directly visible……experience by the wise, are the 6 attributes of the Dhamma) The deity did not understand what he said & asked for more explanation.

He could not answer & suggested her to ask the Buddha. Later the Buddha answered for her & she entered the stream at the end of the talk (became a sotāpanna). It did not mention what happened to Samiddhi. Here one of the interesting point was unwholesome intention turned into wholesome intention & leading to enlightenment by meeting a spiritual friend. Here Sayadaw used these 2 words, kālika (time_consuming) & akālika (timeless or immediate) to give this talk]

There are 2 kāla (time); kālika (time_consuming) & akālika (immediate). Kālika is about family & wealth. Akālika is about insight practice. Another way is working for defilement & killing the defilement. People are following kālika & enjoying in it will encounter great suffering, worry & anxiety. If you do akālika all these will end. (Sayadaw taught them how to use akālika before, & then kālika) As an example, if you want to drink water. First contemplate impermanence of the wanting mind (desire) & then drink the water, etc… This is the right way to do things. 

The Buddha gave this talk to Samiddhi (including the female deity). A deity came to Samiddhi & said to him. “Now you are in your youth & should indulge yourself in kālika (i.e, sensual pleasure) & do the akālika (spiritual practice) later.” Samidhi answered to her, “ I don’t know the time of my death, the type of illness for dying & the place where I have to leave my body. And then also I don’t know where I’ll take my rebirth after death. So I have to do the akālika before.” The deity asked him again & he couldn’t answer it. 

So he suggested her to ask the Buddha. The Buddha said that people took kālika as importance was they were not clear about between concept & reality. They took the mind & body phenomena as me, mine, man & woman. So they suffered for it. Human beings end up in concepts or relative truth that they do all sorts of worldly things (have families, bring up children etc…) If you don’t clear about concept & reality there will be no vipassanā contemplation. 

Therefore find out the reality & contemplate impermanence. At the end of the teaching the deity entered the stream. If you condense the 5 khandas only have the mind & body. Condense the mind & body again only impermanence. Impermanence is the truth of suffering. If you follow to the ending of dukkha it become akālika (timelessness, i.e Nibbāna).
