:summary: Four Nibbānas (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 1st July 1960

There are 4 Nibbānas, sotāpanna Nibbāna, sakatāgāmi Nibbāna, anāgāmi Nibbāna and arahant Nibbāna. There are 4 abandonments with 4 Nibbānas. To become a sotāpanna have to kill ditthi – wrong view. To become sakatāgāmi , anāgāmi and arahant have to kill tanhā.

Now, you are worldlings – puthujjana and must kill ditthi. By killing ditthi and the coarser tanhā with it also gone. Tanhā is not a leading factor here, instead ditthi is the leader. If you ask which tanhā dies with ditthi? This is the coarser tanhā leading to woeful planes. By killing ditthi, this tanhā dies with it.

If you are taking water andthe cup also with It. Ditthi is sticking in the khandha. The eyes contact with visual form is phassa. With phassa good or bad vedana arises. 

If you know in this way the I (self) concept on phassa and vedana are falling away. Because it is only the paramattha dhamma arising. Whatever dhamma arises and follow with knowledge and ditthi falls away. It dispels ditthi because we don’t want birth to arise. (Sayadaw explained up to kamma – bhava on dispelling ditthi)

If you know the present moment D.A. process and ditthi is falling away. In all day, the D.A. processes are going on from the 6 sense – doors. The assemblages of dukkha are going on in turn. These are going on until before death. For birth you have to go after death. 

From the 6 sense – doors whatever arising is only dukkhakkhandhassa – the assembladge of dukkha. Because every time it arises and not knowing is wrong view (taking the experiences as me and mine). If you know it andbecome satipatthāna – mindfulness

At the time of sleep no ditthi with it, and only the bhavanga cittas are arising with sleep. These minds (i.e., bhavanga cittas) can’t give the bad or good results. The mind is doing the natural breathing. 

(Sayadaw said that each day the actions of the D.A. process are arising in uncountable numbers. Therefore the results are also uncountable. Its’ quite terrifying. Therefore to understand the Buddha’s Teachings rightly andcorrectly, it need to understand the D.A. 

We shouldn’t interpret the Buddha’s Teachings with our own views and philosophy. Why the Buddha only taught dukkha andthe end of dukkha was quite clear. The Buddha own enlightenment could not separate from it). 

The wholesome merits you have been made are insignificant, if comparison with the ditthi kammas. These you are creating in the whole day from the 6 sense – doors. (Just think about your whole life) How much terrifying it’s? 

(Therefore the Buddha warned us that our frequent homes were the 4 apāyabhūmis – woeful planes.) D.A. processes are at rest is only in the sleeping time. In dispelling ditthi you have to know the arising dhamma. If you know the arising dhamma will also know the vanishing dhamma. 

For example, looking at the lightening. After a bright light and it instantly disappears. Why? It’s too fast. If you now the arising and ditthi falls off, and knowing the vanishing become vipassanā. It’s easy, and not difficult at all. If you contemplate a lot ditthi becomes thin out with tanhā. With the knowing and ignorance also thins out. 

(continued to talk about Ven. Anuradha) The Buddha was a doctor andonly gave the medicines. It can cure only by taking it. Therefore, we have to extinguish our own hell fire. In the world (loka) only has these 2 dukkhas of dukkha arising and dukkha ceasing.

No person, no beings exist. Only the arising dukkha and the vanishing dukkha exist. After that comes Nibbāna – the permanent extinction of dukkha. A person not knows dukkha and only looking for dukkha. Not knowing the arising is looking for dukkha. 

Because of not knowing the truth (sacca) and saṁsāra is becoming very long. Only can penetrate dukkha sacca and dukkha will cease.
