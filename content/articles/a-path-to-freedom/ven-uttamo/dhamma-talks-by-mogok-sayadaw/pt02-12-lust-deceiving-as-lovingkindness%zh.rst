Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 24th February 1959

Lust can come in and deceiving as loving-kindness (metta), during sending metta only for the loved ones not including others. Metta means for everyone without differentiation. If taṇhā comes in, contemplate this mind state first and continue the metta. Someone who overcomes one’s own mind knows whatever mind state arises. Without overcome it don’t know the mind state. Therefore, there are more unwholesome mind states arising. The best way is contemplating whatever mind state arising. By doing serenity (samatha) practice, defilements can come in the practice. In samatha, if lobha or dosa comes in become unstable, and it falls off. Only vipassanā can be stable.
