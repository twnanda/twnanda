Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; (no date noted)

In the Petakopadesa Text (and old commentary) mentioned as, if someone was wanting to enter the stream had to fulfill these 2 factors. ① Listening to sacca dhamma; ② and after that had right attention, such as materiality, feeling …… consciousness, dukkha sacca, etc. 

There are 2 ways of knowing the truth. Knowing by hearing from a teacher’s teachings. And practice accordingly to the teaching and knowing directly, making decision by oneself. Right attention also 2 kinds. Right attention from the teacher’s teachings. Right attention come from direct practice. 

Decision comes from right attention and with the practice will realize the Path Knowledge. By knowing thoroughly as real dukkha sacca and dukkha disappears (khandha disappears). You know dukkha exists and also not exists. It’s penetrating dukkha. and realizing the cessation. 

Only can make one’s own decision that the 4 Noble Truths will be completed. Heavenly mansions in the celestial realm, hell fire and woks in the hell has arisen are waiting for us. Here dukkha ceases and all these things ready for us are disappeared. With dukkha ceases and the disappearance of the results, these are happening at the same time. 

So you ought to do this task. If you still don’t arrive to this end of knowledge and shouldn’t relax or feel safe. We have uncountable wholesome and unwholesome kamma of our own. 

[The untrained mind usually takes pleasure in unwholesome things. The defiled mind only doing defiled things. Therefore we can justify our wholesome and unwholesome – merits and demerits.] 

You have to demolish the 4 painful rebirths from here. Must take it seriously for your own matter. You have a lot of your own debts. You are still imersion in pleasures. What kind of people you are?

The Buddha taught the way to Nibbāna. Tanhā and ditthi are connecting to each other, as e.g. my son, etc. If you always have dependency on tahā and ditthi and in the state of wavering. [Sayadaw gave the following example. Orchids grow on a rock; with the earth quake, the rock is shaking and the orchids also.

In the Channovada Sutta, Ven. Mahācunda (Sariputta’s brother) was reminding to Ven. Channa, who was very ill and wanted to commit suicide. He told to Ven. Channa, the Buddha taught the monks constantly given close attention to this point. 

For someone had dependency was wavering. Someone was independent was no wavering. Without wavering and there was tranquility and no inclination. Without inclination, no coming and going, nor passing away and being reborn. There was neither here nor beyond nor in between the 2. This was the end of dukkha.] 

Our khandhas connect with tanhā and ditthi, e.g. if you’re sick. The khandha is always changing and perishing. If you always have affection to the khandha with tanhā and ditthi and it’s always connecting. These 2 dhammas are very important. (i.e., tanhā/ditthi and khandha). 

You’re very pleasing with the wavering. If khandha and tanhā/ditthi are not connecting and no wavering. How to do it for not having wavering? By watching and observing the khandha and you’ll see its unstoppable perishing? If you see impermanence and tanhā/ditthi are falling off. Tanhā and ditthi are the closet to our khandha. 

Vipassanā is watching and observing the nature of the khandha for what is happening to it. If, it’s rising and falling and just knowing it as rising and falling. If, it’s in dukkha and just knowing it as in dukkha. If, it’s showing not yours and just knowing it as not yours. Watching and observing it like a stranger (alien) and will know the anatta nature. Someone not in wavering, mind and body are peaceful and free from kilesa. 

By knowing its nature thoroughly free from kilesa. Doing the sitting and observing do you need to be taught? Watching and observing with ñāṇa and the khandha’ll tell its nature. With a lot of contemplation will understand dukkha nature. It has dukkha and only tell dukkha to you about dukkha.
