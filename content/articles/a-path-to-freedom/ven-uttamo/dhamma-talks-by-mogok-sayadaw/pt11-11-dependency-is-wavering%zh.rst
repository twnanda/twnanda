Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; (no date noted)

It mentioned that someone had to fulfill these two factors if he wanted to enter the stream in the Petakopadesa Text (and old commentary): ① Listening to sacca dhamma; and ② after that, having right attention, such as materiality, feeling …… consciousness, dukkha sacca, etc.

There are two ways of knowing the truth: knowing by hearing from a teacher’s teachings; and practicing accordingly to the teaching and knowing directly, making decision by oneself. There are also two kinds of right attention: Right attention from the teacher’s teachings; and right attention come from direct practice. 

Decision comes from right attention and with the practice will realize the Path Knowledge. By knowing thoroughly as real dukkha sacca and dukkha disappears (khandha disappears). You know dukkha exists and also not exists. It’s penetrating dukkha and realizing the cessation. 

The four Noble Truths will be completed only one can make one’s own decision. Heavenly mansions in the celestial realm, hell fire and woks in the hell has arisen are waiting for us. Here dukkha ceases and all these things ready for us are disappeared. With dukkha ceases and the disappearance of the results, these are happening at the same time. 

So you ought to do this task. If you still don’t arrive to this end of knowledge and shouldn’t relax or feel safe. We have uncountable wholesome and unwholesome kammas of our own. 

[The untrained mind usually takes pleasure in unwholesome things. The defiled mind only does defiled things. Therefore we can justify our wholesome and unwholesome – merits and demerits.] 

You have to demolish the four painful rebirths from here. You must take it seriously for your own matter. You have a lot of your own debts. You are still immersed in pleasures. What kind of people you are?

The Buddha taught the way to Nibbāna. Taṇhā and diṭṭhi are connecting to each other, as example, my son, etc. It's in the state of wavering if you always have dependency on taṇhā and diṭṭhi. [Sayadaw gave the following example. Orchids grow on a rock; with the earth quake, the rock is shaking and the orchids also.

In the Channovada Sutta, Ven. Mahācunda (Sāriputta’s younger brother) reminded Ven. Channa who was very ill and wanted to commit suicide. He told to Ven. Channa, the Buddha taught the monks constantly giving close attention to this point. 

It was wavering for someone who had dependency; whereas it was no wavering for someone who was independent. Without wavering, there was tranquility and no inclination. Without inclination, there is no coming and going, nor passing away and being reborn. There was neither here nor beyond nor in between these two. This was the end of dukkha.] 

Our khandhas connect with taṇhā and diṭṭhi, e.g., if you’re sick. The khandha is always changing and perishing. If you always have affection to the khandha with taṇhā and diṭṭhi and it’s always connecting. These two dhammas are very important. (i.e., taṇhā/diṭṭhi and khandha). 

You’re very pleasing with the wavering. There is no wavering if khandha and taṇhā/diṭṭhi are not connected. How to do it for not having wavering? By watching and observing the khandha, you’ll see its unstoppable perishing. If you see impermanence, taṇhā / diṭṭhi is falling off. Taṇhā and diṭṭhi are the closest to our khandha. 

Vipassanā is watching and observing the nature of the khandha for what is happening to it. If it’s rising and falling, just know it as rising and falling. If it’s in dukkha, just know it as in dukkha. If it’s showing not yours, just know it as not yours. Watching and observing it like a stranger (alien), you will know the anatta nature. Someone not in wavering, mind and body are peaceful and he is free from kilesa. 

You will be free from kilesa by knowing its nature thoroughly. Doing the sitting and observing do you need to be taught? Watching and observing with ñāṇa, the khandha will tell its nature. You will understand dukkha nature with a lot of contemplation. It has dukkha and only tells dukkha to you about dukkha.
