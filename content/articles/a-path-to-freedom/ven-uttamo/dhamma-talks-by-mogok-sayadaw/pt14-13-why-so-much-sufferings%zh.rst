Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 7th to 8th October 1961

T1

Which way is the quickest way to end taṇhā? With taṇhā ends arriving at Nibbāna. (Contemplation of feelings (vedanās) is the quickest way to end Taṇhā or Dukkha). If I have to talk about Nibbāna which is no need to carry around the khandha burdens.  There is no feeding and cleansing of its 'bitterness' (Dukkhas). Thus, there is no quest for wealth and property (power). There is no "suffering" of remaining in someone else's womb (birth). There is no suffering (dukkha) caused by disease.  There is also no dukkha of relying on others during sickness, and no dukkha of sorrow, lamentation, pain and grief at near death (seeing signs of unwholesomeness with painful destinations and attachment to wealth and family members). Why I have to exhort you everyday is wanting you to die with smile.

(Sayadaw mentioned the terrible dying moment and painful situations). The Buddha himself was warning us for 32 times in his life: Don’t be heedless; practise diligently until your bones and fleshes are worn out, blood dried up. The wealth and possessions (powers) which you earned even can’t stop the dying sickness and disease. The truly reliable thing is only maggaṅga (the path factors). (Mentioned the sufferings of Hells. This is not like the mythology of God and Creation. With Dhamma practices can find it out by oneself. 

Kanni meditation develops light nimitta which can discern the 31 realms of existence. There are two books which I know mentioned the yogis' experiences about these realms. The strange thing is most of the world religions accept the existence of hells).

You don’t need or spend money for it, only have to use your nyan (ñāṇa). Only have to nod your head at what the khandha is telling you. There is no khandha not talking about their stories. (Sayadaw told about Sakka—King of the 33 gods in the Cūḷataṇhāsaṅkhaya Sutta, Sutta No. 37, Majjhima N.) If vedanā arising you have to observe as it’s still there or not there. You’ll have the path factors if you discern it not there anymore. You insert the knowledge of seeing the dissolution of vedanā. Then feeling conditions taṇhā not arise (vedanā → taṇhā) (The Buddha gave the instruction to Sakka) The knowledge which discerning the dissolution comes in and cut off the process. vedanā paccaya taṇhā is the Pāli words which refers to people not doing vipassanā. (feeling conditions taṇhā) vedanā paccaya paññā—feeling conditions wisdom is someone discerning anicca. Taṇhā disappears by discerning anicca. vedanā nirodha taṇhā nirodho—With the cessation of feeling and taṇhā (craving) ceases. If you can make feeling into cessation it becomes path factors. The task of no sympathy to oneself is business matters, but the task of practicing the path is having sympathy to oneself. Therefore, in the world there are more people who have no sympathy for themselves. (This is not an exaggeration; the Buddha himself admonished us as-the permanent homes of living beings are the four woeful planes of existence).

Where Taṇhā is staying? It’s at one’s khandha. You want the khandha to be good. Therefore, taṇhā will be cut off if you kill feelings. This is a very important point. If you want taṇhā dies then contemplate feelings. Discerning the impermanence of feelings and taṇhā will die. (Retold the Sakka’s story) You have to note that whatever suffering in the world is giving by taṇhā. With more riches or wealth there is more dukkha. you have to work more than others, and also endure more than others. Therefore, with more taṇhā and there will be more sufferings. 

(If you have more, and more suffering; with little, and little suffering; with nothing, and no suffering— this is the saying of Tibetan yogi Milarepa, But humans want or crave for more and no limitations, if the gods rain-down precious jewels from the sky they are still discontent, especially politicians and economists-their slogan is power and more money! money! and becoming a crazy world.)

The human world is full of suffering, and after death one goes to HELL!  Do you have any profits? You’re seeking suffering for yourselves. Is it clear? If I do not explain to you all these things are inspiring (nourishing taṇhā and Dukkha); and then you all will expect for sufferings (fools teach people become fools, blindness leads to darkness). [Here Sayadaw’s talk becomes humorous]. All the sufferings come from Taṇhā. Where is taṇhā coming from? It’s from feelings.

Let us insert path factors between feelings and taṇhā. Becoming a Buddha is not under the Bodhi Tree, at between vedanā and taṇhā. Any Buddha is between here. Becoming a sotāpanna to arahant are also between here. Asking you to contemplate your mind also includes vedanā. Mind and feeling are sampayutta dhamma— phenomena associated together. It was like fire and light which were arising together. Mind and feeling are arising together. Contemplate it whatever you prefer. There are two happiness (sukha) of mind and body (Sayadaw gave worldly examples for them). There are two dukkhas (sufferings) of mind and body (Sayadaw gave examples for them). There are two neither sukha nor dukkha of mind and body (i.e., upekkhā— Sayadaw gave examples. Check the Cūḷataṇhāsaṅkhaya Sutta). Taṇhā ceased by contemplating feelings. With taṇhā dies and Dukkha ceases. If you’re praying for becoming a human being is the same as— let me run towards from ageing to sickness and from sickness to death (So silly!) Khandha is proving it to you (Khandha is proving this to you)

Knowledge can arise following behind the anicca of feelings. If you discerning anicca arrive at the halfway of the journey. vedanā is abandoned by discerning of vedanā anicca (vedanā is one of the khandhas; so it’s also abandoned khandhas) Taṇhā also can’t follow behind that it also abandoning of taṇhā. Have to remember that vipassanā practice is the task of abandoning of khandha and taṇhā— Abandonment of khandha is the ending of Dukkha. The abandonment of taṇhā is the ending of the cause (condition) of Dukkha. vipassanā is very beneficial and the vipassanā knowledge testify this point. (The explanation of 12 links as three lives time is valid.)
