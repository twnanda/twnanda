Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 12th September 1961

[ In this talk Sayadaw explained the two views on vipassanā. These two views are; ① Vipassanā observe by oneself ② Vipassanā show by the khandhas. It becomes arguments among yogis. He said both are right. The mind always turn inwards the khandha becomes vipassanā. The mind knows or sees the khandha process. Without turns inwards and observes can’t discern the khandha process.

The dhamma shows its nature and becomes vipassanā. The mind observes and becomes vipassanā. These two combine together become vipassanā ñāṇa. The dhamma is always showing its nature. Vipariṇāma lakkhaṇaṁ dukkha saccaṁ — changing and unstable nature are truth of dukkha. 

Is vipassanā extinct then dhamma extinct? Or does the mind not turn inwards and observe? In these two questions; no vipassanā means there is without any observation. Don’t forget “ehi-passiko”. (There are six attributes of Dhamma. Ehi-passiko is one of them). The dhamma are inviting us, come and contemplate or observe. Ehi and passiko combining together becomes vipassanā. 

The arising dhamma combines with the observing mind become vipassanā. Why are we so long in saṁsāra? Because ehi — the dhamma invites us all the times but we don’t follow with their invitation and rejecting it all the times. So, don’t separate ehi and passiko. If separate just wandering in saṁsāra. It will end suffering with not separating them. ]

In the Majjhima Nikāya, the Buddha said, you had to put down the khandha here. But to get another new khandha was the greatest fault. It was the most fearful thing for the Buddha. It was dukkha sacca and the Buddha disgusted about it. Your wisdom eyes are covering up with kilesa dusts. 

So you all are making prayers for the next khandhas. If you are asking for life will be sunk in deeper. Craving for becoming (bhava taṇhā) is comforting you with pleasure and never find out for liberation. It’s like I may miss every Buddha to come if you are praying for existence. Some pray for liberation at the time of the future Metteyya Buddha. This is a kind of terrible thing to do. 

Because in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, The Buddha gave the guarantee for a mature mind could realize the dhamma within seven days. This is a kind of disrespectful to the Gautama Buddha. It is unnecessary to do this kind of thing. 

Even Gautama Buddha could not give you Nibbāna. Have to practice yourself for it. Metteyya Buddha also can’t give it to you in the future. You must practice for yourself. Each Nibbāna is not different from others Nibbāna. This is attachment to the personality. So you have wrong view. In saṁsāra it is one day long dukkha if you survive for one more day. Do not want a long suffering life. You have to follow the quicker way to Nibbāna. 

We must do the vipassanā practice. What is vipassanā? There are two views on vipassanā. ① One’s own contemplation is vipassanā. ② There is also vipassanā shown by the dhamma and seeing it. ① is seeing with one’s own contemplation. ② is the dhamma showing it and you see it. (In the beginning ① is more prominent; then it becomes mature with the practice and ② is more prominent). 

This is never taught before. There are a lot of arguments. I will explain these two views as not wrong. The khandhas do its work as rise and fall even you don’t contemplate. If you do not contemplate, does it become vipassanā? Stay away from the five cords of sensual pleasure and turning the mind towards it and become vipassanā. Turn your mind towards the khandha. The mind sees the khandha process. 

This is seeing by contemplation. No contemplation is no seeing. Contemplative mind is vipassanā ñāṇa. This is from the point of knowledge. The dhamma also has to show it. So the dhamma shows and the mind contemplates, and contemplation becomes vipassanā with both. Extinctions of the Dhamma can be measured with this point. 

The mind not turning towards it that Dhamma become in extinction. Ehi and passiko together become insight. Saṁsāra is long because ehi and passiko are not together. Therefore we are in trouble. You will reach towards Nibbāna with them together. You may think it is the cause of taṇhā and avijjā. In truth, saṁsāra is long on not combining ehi and passiko together. 

No contemplation is heedless. Heedlessness is ignorance. Ignorance conditions volitional formation (avijjā paccaya saṅkhāra)..., and D. A. continues. But you follow ehi with greed, hatred and delusion that saṁsāra is long. For example, mosquito bites you. You slap it with your hand. You have to go there with knowledge (ñāṇa). 

Then you will see anicca, before that all of you were going to the four planes of misery. Now! You do know how to go Nibbāna. So Nibbāna is not come to you by prayers.
