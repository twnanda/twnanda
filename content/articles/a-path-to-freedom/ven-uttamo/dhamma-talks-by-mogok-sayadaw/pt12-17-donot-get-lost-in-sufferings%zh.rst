:summary: Don’t Get Lost in Sufferings (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; no date noted

You all want happiness is seeking for the world of beings (satta loka) and the world of planes (ākāsa loka). If you’re praying for satta loka and that is praying for aging, sickness and death. Changing of ākāsa loka is also changing the places for burying the corpses. (i.e., the 31 planes of existence). 

The conditioned world is also not good (i.e., saṅkhāra loka). It’s ending with impermanence. Formations are saṅkhāra (i.e., the 5 khandhas). Vanishing is anicca. These are arising and vanishing. Therefore you have to practice for the transcending of saṅkhāra loka. Saṅkhāra loka is the world worn – out living beings.

(Saṅkhāra loka is the most important one of the three. Without it all living beings are in peace and supreme happiness. Understanding of saṅkhāra loka or saṅkhāra dukkha on the conventional and ultimate levels are very important for all Buddhists, especially for yogis. Only with these 2 knowledges we can walk or work on the middle way and letting go of all clingings which are the sources of all different kinds of dukkha.

Human beings and societies are the best dhamma lessons and dhamma objects for studies and contemplations which confirm what the Buddha taught for 45 yrs. Satta loka and ākāsa loka are mostly coming from the human mind the saṅkhāra loka).

Any loka is not good. If we don’t get out from these 3 worlds can’t stop sufferings to happen. If you’re looking for goodness in loka and will never have it. If I give you the blessings also become empty. In loka nothing can be finished. It’s going on and on.

If seeing impermanence, ñāṇa abandons khandha and kilesa. Therefore diṭṭhi and tanhā die. Someone dies with this mind and born in sugati (here referred to the heaven). After arriving there will enter the stream. Death consciousness and birth consciousness are close to each other (anantara paccayo – proximity condition, no intermediate state and not a soul or entity.) 

Therefore these dhamma are arising there. Even enter the stream is earlier then arriving there. (Sayadaw didn’t explain what it meant and why? With the Abhidhammea knowledge it can be possible because the mind is rising and falling faster than the body in 20 times). 

Therefore insight knowledge is quite beneficial. With diṭṭhi falls off and entering the stream. With the diṭṭhi tanhā dies and not falls into apāya. 

(He continued to talk on the practice up to the path knowledge arises)

Insight knowledge (vipassanā magga) abandons the khandha and kilesa but not see Nibbāna. Path knowledge abandon the khandha and kilesas and also sees Nibbāna. These were mentioned in the Milinda Pañha and Visudhimagga Texts. After vipassanā magga ends and Nibbāna arises (anantarapaccayo – proximity condition). 

(continued to talk on the 5 faculties – indriyas. In the 5 faculties mindfulness (sati) is never in excessive. You must always have it and watching the objects.
