:summary: Two Ways of Dying (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 29th August 1962

Listening to dhamma talks are for the freedom of death. (This was true for Sayadaw and his disciples. Is it true for all Buddhists? Some Buddhists expounded new ideas and philosophy for the becoming – bhava – tanhā). During the listening of talk, we are moving towards death. 

I’ll teach you the way of dying. (Told the story of Ven. Phugguna, the sick monk at near death) Khandha accepts every – thing you all are fear. Therefore if you’re staying longer with it and becomes worsening. All dukkha are accumulated with it. Someone not knowing the truth is a crazy and blind person. 

Do you still have desire for this useless khandha? (Sayadaw mentioned some problems of the khandha.) It’s not beneficial to look after the khandha. It’s only moving towards aging, sickness and death. Collecting wealths and other things for this khandha without any benefit is dukkha sacca. But it’s never arising to our mind as enough is enough. 

Ven. Phugguna died as an anāgāmi (non – returner). His eye,… … bodily faculties were clear and bright and looked like alive person. There are 2 ways of dying; → ① Die with listening to talks ② Contemplation on one’s khandha and die. You have to listen the kind of dhamma talks to understand dukkha sacca. 

(This point is very important to keep in mind. Because Ven. Sariputta gave talk to his friend, the brahman who was dying with samatha and reborn as a Brahma god. Later he had to go there again and gave another talk on truth (sacca dhamma). He also gave sacca dhamma to Anatthapindika at his death bed. It should be this kind of talks).

If the dying person had time and listened to the Buddha’s talk or one of the disciples’ talk (Here Ven. Phugguna listened to the Buddha’s talk) If you don’t have time for these and contemplate by yourself near death. At near death usually dukkha vedana will arise. Contemplating it as impermanent, oppressive, dukkha sacca khandha and follow with maggan. 

Therefore in this way is dying with magga. Someone in pain is the nature of dukkha vedana. With the arising and vanishing that vedana disappears. Vedana is anicca and contemplative mind is anicca ñāṇa. It’s not easy to listen talk near death. You have to look for a person to give talk. 

Also he must be a person can give sacca dhamma. (Nowadays is easy because we can access recorded tapes on Dhamma. Some of Mogok Sayadaw’s close disciples were dying by listening to his recorded tapes. In Sayadaw’s Biography, once time he mentioned to a disciple the benefit of recorded tapes and recorder. 

If we can use it properly even it can send us to Nibbāna, and blissful births. Using it wrongly send us to hells, animals and ghosts realms. Nowadays medias are choosing the second way. Doors to hells, animals and ghost realms are opening to most of us). 

Therefore the best way of dying is with one’s own contemplation or practice. King Milinda asked; “Can All attain Nibbāna?” The answer was not all. The one who can attain Nibbāna is: ① What should has to be known with penetration must penetrate it. 

What should has to be known with analysis has to be analyzed. ② What should has to be abandoned has to be abandoned. ③ What should must be realized has to be realized. ④ What should has to be developed has to be developed. (All these are about the Noble Truths). One who knows the truths will attain Nibbāna. [This is no. ① point].

If you don’t try even one of them and only has zero left. And then I myself can’t help you. If you try one dukkha sacca and all are included. (This was from Saccasaṁyutta) The maggan analyze it as dukkha sacca. So it includes magga sacca. Magga arises and samudaya ceases. Khadhanirodho nibbānaṁ – the cessation of khandha is Nibbāna. And nirodha sacca appears.
