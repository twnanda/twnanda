Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 25th December 1960

I’ll teach you the contemplation of feeling. If you want to become a noble person, should know these 7 points on feeling. 

| ① To know how many feeling are there? (Other khandhas are also have to know with these 7 points.) 
| ② To know the cause of feeling. 
| ③ To know the cessation of feeling. 
| ④ To know the practice leading to the cessation of feeling. 
| ⑤ To know the gratification (assāda) on feeling when it arises.
| ⑥ To know the danger (ādinava) of feeling
| ⑦ To know the escape (nisarana) from feeling
| 

You have to know these things before. 

① To know 6 kinds of feeling (Feelings arise from the 6 sense  – doors. Here Sayadaw mentioned 13 types of feeling which are arising from the 6 sense  – doors according to his teaching on the contemplation of feeling). 

② All these feelings arise from contact (phassa). Phassa paccaya vedana –  contact conditions feeling.

③ With the cessation of contact and feeling also ceases. Because it caused by contact

④ Practice with the 5 path factors. The yogi has to know the arising and passing away. Knowing is maggaṅga (path factors). This is knowing the cessation of feeling. If all feelings come to the cessation and what’ll leave behind? This is the cessation of dukkha sacca. Have to practice up to this point.

⑤ if you don’t practice in this way, because of feeling and gratification arises (assāda). Taking them with pleasure arises. For e.g., it’s pleasant to see it. With pleasure arises and following behind are craving, clinging and action. I am worrying about craving arising and telling you practice for the cessation. 

Is it not sure, if pleasure arises and dukkha will follow? Taking no.④as a main point for practice. What I am teaching is also focus on no.④. (That is true. With research on Sayadaw’s talks and find out that mostly he concentrated on this point).

⑥ If pleasure arises and you’ll fall into the danger of dukkha. (ādīnava). And then tanhā, upādāna, kamma and jati will follow. If gratification arises (assāda) and these things will follow behind (i.e., craving, clinging, action and birth). So, it’s impossible not to contemplate (i.e., must have to do it).

⑦ If you want to know the escape from feeling, practice with no. ④. And then, it’ll become the 8 path factors (i.e., escape from feeling or dukkha). This dhamma was showing the process of the practice (by the Buddha). ④ First, contemplate with the 5 magganga. If you succeed and will fulfill the 8 path factors.

⑥ Feeling is under the fault of 3 characteristics, such as impermanence, suffering and not – self. Doing the contemplation is to understand the fault or danger. With the contemplation and knowing the 2 faults of the khandha. 

First, with the contemplation and knowing the fault of khandha with the 3 characteristics. Second, without the contemplation and knowing that the khandha dukkha processes are following someone. We are always under the fault of 3 characteristics. 

Can you destroy it? And if we know under the fault of 3 characteristics. and will escape from it. Do you still want it? If you don’t want and will not get it. Not getting it and become free. I’ll talk about another way of without the contemplation how dangers arise (the connection of D.A. process).

I’ll talk only regard to seeing. The fish in the water dies on land. You may ask, the fish in the water should die in the water. It dies on land because of encountering danger. There are also men die in water. (fishermen). They die for feeling. If there are no feelings, do they need to die? The fish in the water is seeing the bait with the hook. Just seeing is neither pleasant nor unpleasant – neutral feeling (upekkha vedana). After seeing and wanting to eat pleasant feeling arises (somanassa vedana or tanhā). And eats the bait and pierces its mouth with the hook. After it arrives on land and beaten by a stick and dies with painful feeling. (dukkha vedana). 

Neutral feeling is the showman. Pleasant feeling is the gulper or swallower. And painful feeling is the killer. These are showing the danger of feeling. Which type of feeling is your friend? All 3 feelings are the messengers of death. They all are enemies. We can’t overcome these 3 feelings and always living with death.

Therefore you can’t leave feelings on it own. (Sayadaw continued to explain about feeling connects with the 5 other sense – doors in the daily life). These 3 feelings exist in your khandha and will kill you together. You are also living with these 3 feelings.

Therefore the Buddha said; vedana māro – feeling is the murderer, or killer. The messenger of death have to be contemplated in this way. Without them and only free from death. Therefore, have to contemplate until it extincts. If not, they’ll kill you. They are the most fearful things. 

We are living together with the messenger of death. Don’t want to contemplate feeling and prefer them is still wanting to die. By hearing about heaven is good and prefer heaven. We are taking the Brahma world also in the same way. Wherever you’ll be and will kill by them. 

Tonight I am talking about feeling very clear. Whatever life you are praying and asking for feeling, it is the same as may I meet the murderers. May I live with them together. Without knowing them and it happens in foolish ways. Therefore there are only murderers in the 31 realms of existence. 

You have to practice to escape from feeling. Seeing impermanent of feeling; and them its disenchantment and not wanting it. Then you’ll not get the aggregate of feeling. Not getting it and free from death. And then you are separating from the murderers. 

Today talk is emphasizing on practice. And also it includes sense of urgency (saṁvega). You are out of your mind, if you make friends with the 3 murderers. If you can contemplate to see impermanent, disenchantment and not wanting it and the 8 factors will complete. With the khandha disappears and no khandha for dying anymore. No khandha for dying is Nibbāna.
