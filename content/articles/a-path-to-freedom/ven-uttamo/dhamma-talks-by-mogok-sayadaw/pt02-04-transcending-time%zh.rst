Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 24th August 1958

[This is one of the Buddha’s teachings on time and space; it's explained by Sayadaw with humor. It looks like a Buddhist science and philosophy. It reminds us Einstein’s theory on time/space. He discovered more than 3 dimensions. The Buddha discovered directly multiple dimensions and the state of no dimension or timelessness and spacelessness.]

Morning and night times are eating the khandha (eyes, ears, etc.). Every day the body becomes weak and is getting old. Don’t stay under the sun and moon. When getting old everything is lost. Whatever khandha you get, it will never free from the sun and moon. So the khandhas are always eaten by them. Good kamma and intelligence are reducing every day. Chickens, pigs, animals are eaten by human beings but they (men) themselves are also eaten by time. Without the sun and moon there will be no time. Chickens in a farm will be eaten by their master is for sure every day. Therefore 31-realms of existence are like chicken cages. 

Asking for someone when this person had died is the same as when he had eaten by time. There is no sun and moon in Nibbāna so it’s timeless. There is also no 4-elements (earth, water, fire and air elements), only with happiness and liberation. We were eating by time for uncountable lives and time-span. We must try to re-eat them. First, we have to eat time. Second, must come out from time span. If you are making prayer to be a rat ~ it means I may be eaten by cat. Praying to become a deva or Brahma is also like praying for a rat. Getting old is eaten by time. Dying is killing by time. After eaten become clean (disappear). (Sayadaw continued to teach vipassanā practice by using the Paṭiccasamuppāda.) As an example a desire to eat something arise (here the mind) and observe it. On the body if itchy sensation arises, don’t follow with the hand. Differentiate them as a little itching, a middling itching and a strong itching. After a little itching and then a middling itching arises. All of them are arising one by one. Observe their differences. Analysing the feelings and cutting of the continuity (i.e., santati). After pleasant feeling (sukha vedanā) ceases, the small unpleasant feeling (dukkha vedanā) arises. After the small unpleasant feeling ceases, the middling unpleasant feeling arises. After the middling one ceases the strong one arises. After the strong one ceases, the pleasant feeling re-appears. (Here Sayadaw gave an example of an unpleasant feeling process and how to contemplate them.) Knowing the spaces between them is the present knowledge. In this way we must eat the future time with Path Knowledge. Then we shall transcend time-span and liberate from their eating.
