Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 5th December 1961

[A talk on dāna offering. U Kyaw Thein and Daw Tin Hla (a couple) offering a Dhamma Hall for practice. Sayadaw explained to them how to make dāna for a decisive support – upanisaya for Nibbāna.]

Dāna gives the rebirth – linking result (patisandhi) and present life result (pavutti). Pavutti result means to encounter with a good teacher and helping a decisive support for the cause of the path. It is leading to the path condition (magga paccayo).

To encounter a good teacher is the power of decisive support. Dāna also a decisive support for the path condition. To arrive human world and encounter with the Buddha’s Teachings are upanisaya. Without upanisaya and having the ñāṇa ear to listen sacca dhamma is impossible. 

The Buddha himself said that upanisaya helped the path condition and could let Path and Fruition Knowledges to arise. (Sayadaw talked about the 5 results came from the offering of monastery buildings in the Aṅguttara Nikāya These are: Ayu, vanna, sukha, paññā and bala – long life, good looking, happiness, wisdom and power). W

ealths and properties can be changed at anytime before death. It can be met with the 5 dangers of water, fire, king, thieves and one’s own family members. It can be also misued and spending them with one’s kilesa. Therefore dāna offering are like taking things out from a house on fire. If you die and can’t take it with you and have to leave behind.

(People not doing dāna, merits and wholesome things are foolish indeed. Because human world is the most important place for living beings to cultivate goodness and practicing for transcending dukkha. Instead most human beings are wasting their precious time and chances with sensual pleasure and unwholesome dhamma). 

Dāna offerings are like taking things out from the burning house and save it as one’s own properties. Should not think it as reducing or spending your wealths. 31 realms of existence are kilesa fire. So they are burning with the fire of dukkha. The Buddha was admonishing us for not taking out things from the burning fire.” 

(Even most people even don’t know as these are burning with fire. And it’s worth to do it. Here Sayadaw mentioned a current news happened in Rangoon where a man was robbed and killed by robbers). His khandha and properties are burned down with fire. 

(Again Sayadaw talked about the last day of the Buddha. The Buddha laid down his burdened khandha at the sal – grove in Kusinārā. Because of the saṅkhāra dhamma and nothing was left there nowadays. All the grandeur was gone. It was quite a saṁvega story. 

It was not more than a dream). By performing dāna and it finished with anicca. If you don’t perform it also the same nature. Dāna offerings with the enriching of wisdom are finished the same. But it is following with non – greed, loving kindness and wisdom (alobha, adosa and amoha). If you let it finishing by itself and following with lobha, dosa and moha. The differences are one ends dukkha. and the other connecting dukkha. (We should think about this point seriously).

(Sayadaw talked about the 6 wholesome and unwholesome mind mentioned about with the D.A. process.) Offering dāna with alobha, adosa and amoha (paññā) is not connecting saṁsāra. Offering with seeing dukkha sacca and can’t connect dukkha. Not wanting is magga – alobha. Not wanting the khandha and properties are offering with magga. (He instructed the couple how to have right attention). 

The khandha is always burning with 11 kinds of fire. To have the khandha is becoming fuels. Therefore wanting to end the fuels (khandha) and extinguishing the fire (kilesa) that we are performing dāna. A dāna combines with truth (sacca) and volition (cetana). Cetana (kamma) has to follow behind knowledge. 

(Sayadaw gave an example with the Buddha) The Bodhisatta (Buddha to – be), for many past lives (incalculable) had done a lot of great dāna paramis (perfection for givings), but only with the knowledge of becoming a Buddha. If his volitions (cetana/kamma) had to follow him would not become a Buddha. 

But only let cetana following behind knowledge (ñāna) that became a Buddha, and attained Nibbāna. Nyan as a predominant quality is seeing dukkha. Nyan as a leader and cetana as a follower. Nyan is making the kammic power becomes weakened. Therefore it’s the dhamma cutting off kamma.
