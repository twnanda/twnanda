:summary: How to Pay your Debts? (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 7th December 1961

Because of inversions D.A process continues. Conceit (māna) is not arising together with wrong view. Māna is also taṇhā. Because of the perception of permanence (nicca saññā) that māna arises. With māna people encounter with law cases. Because of the perception of beauty (subha saññā) and ordinary taṇhā arises. Mostly happen with consumer goods. Making these things nice to look with attration. 

People with taṇhā buy these things (Consumerism is nowadays create a big problem in society and environments. There are a lot of needs to contemplate for these human problems connection with taṇhā). Shopkeepers have good sales is subha saññā. Because of the perception of self (atta saññā) and wrong view of stability arises. As an e.g. people are looking and searching for the stable things. 

All 3 of them are proliferation phenomena (papañca dhamma). All start from perception. Therefore you must note as nicca saññā extends the D.A of conceit, subha saññā for taṇhā and atta saññā for diṭṭhi respectively. With these perceptions exist can’t realize Nibbāna. For nicca saññā contemplates anicca. For subha (beauty) contemplates asubha (foulness of the body) or anicca. 

We also have to do dāna (giving), sīla (precept) and samatha (calm). With these practices will meet good teachers and Dhamma (These points are important. Can see many evidences in the Nikāyas. of the 9 attributes of the Buddha, one of them is vijjā-carana-sampanno. Vijjā is knowledge represents wisdom. Carana is conduct, represents dāna, sīla and samatha most Buddhists think only a bodhisatta or a Buddha need it. 

Some Buddhists just do carana and neglect vijjā and some in the opposite. It’s a very rare opportunity come to the human world not just for sensual pleasure. It’s for the cultivation of goodness for oneself and others and purify the mind (vijjā-carana). Because the human world is the international air-port to other destinations). 

These dhammas are decisive support conditions (upanisaya paccayo), distant causes for Nibbāna. Insight knowledge is Path Condition (magga paccayo), near cause to direct Nibbāna. Note this point carefully. If not, may be you can think that with only good merits arrive Nibbāna. With the analytical knowledge of conditional Relations (the Paṭṭhāna) without magga paccayo never arrives Nibbāna. 

All other dhammas can’t abandon perception (saññā). These are supporting Nibbāna only. For an e.g. an animal can be arrived to human world again. Because of his/her good merits meets a good teacher and dhamma (see Maechee Kaaw’s Biography) But by sleeping nothing will happen. Must practice vipassanā. Therefore don’t abandon any of them (i.e. vijjā and carana).

(Continued the story of Anāthapiṇḍika and the wanderers, about the QandA between them). Amāravikkhepa diṭṭhi (evasion) means, if asking a question and not giving an exact answer as yes or no. Why give this kind of answer? Doesn’t know clearly by oneself and when asking it’s not good to give no answer (Therefore the person gives an evasive answer). 

So, come this view. (Sāriputta’s first teacher Sañjaya held this view). Wrong view comes from not knowing the anicca and saṅkhata dhammas. Here Anāthapiṇḍika pointed out unwise attention and listening wrong teachings as 2 causes for their wrong views, to arise. There are 8 causes for wrong views and these 2 points are very important. With unwise attention 12 inversions arise. 

The 4 D.A processes of taṇhā, dosa, māna and diṭṭhi from the 6 sense doors are arising uncountable for everyday. Black dhammas gives the black results. Most people think only by wholesome and unwholesome volition that results arise. This is the knowledge of ordinary people. 

There are more than that (These things are becoming more clear by understanding the D.A processes. Only by studying the suttas in the Pali Nikāyas understand the dangers of saṁsāra). These khammas will make the khandhas (taṇhā, dosa, māna, diṭṭhi arise from the 6 sense doors). 

Therefore how do you repay for them? You have to repay it with the khandhas. So, I had been told you very often that you were coming here for a visit. Later went back to you permanent places (i.e. 4 woeful planes). All these things have to be decided with the D.A processes. Not with you sīla. These khandha debts can be only repaid with vipassanā knowledge and the Path Knowledge. 

Even in this life time your kammic debts are not few. Also the kammas of the past lives are waiting for the chances to give the results. It’s like this example, someone has million dollars in debt. But he is an ordinary worker. Can he pays back his debts? The Buddha arose in this world for this purpose. 

Now, you find the way of how to pay the debts. But it will never solve by kammas. Must pay the debt with knowledge. For e.g, the creditor comes and tells you, just licking these salts for once and all you debts are exempted. It’s important for you to realize the Path Knowledge for only once (i.e. sotāpatti magga). Then all the infinity of your debts are exempted.

The life span of blissful planes (sugatis) are like a pebble, throwing upwardly into the sky and staying there for a moment only. The life span in hells are like this pebble falling back to the ground and staying there for a long time (quite painful and frightening indeed). Whatever arises from the 6 sense doors, can contemplate the impermanence and 10 kinds of D.A process can’t arise (Just mentioned before, taṇhā, dosa, māna, diṭṭhi are arising from the 6 sense doors).

Therefore even insight knowledges (vipassana magga) have the great benefit. The Buddha taught 3 universal characteristics but all are in the arising and passing away (anicca) (Three characteristics fall into dukkha sacca. Therefore penetrate dukkha is very important. Only then you can let go of your clinging to things. So the Buddha said he only taught dukkha and the end of dukkha). 

Because impermanence is dukkha sacca. All the other animals’ foot prints fall into the foot print of an elephant (Māha-hatthipadopama sutta, Majjma Nikāya). Vipassana magga can only cut off this life kamma. Lokuttara magga (Supramundane) cut off past, present and future kammas. This is the difference between these 2 knowledges. The important thing you must remember is doing the job of magga before for the sake of safety death (for not fall into painful births). 

Later you can do other things which are not important. It you die earlier before that, will be very difficult for you. The kammas of this life and many of past lives are waiting for you to push you down (to painful births, hells, animals, hungry ghosts) at near death.
