Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 9th October 1961

Whenever a Buddha appears, he will teach it only once. It’s difficult to hear this talk by human beings (Referred to Devadūta Sutta: Divine Messengers, No.130-Majjhima N.) The Buddha taught us not to forget the Noble Task: You must turn your knowledge (ñāṇa) towards the khandha. At other times, your mind is turned towards the outside world. Even when you turn the mind towards the khandha with the wrong view of "Me," and sometimes with taṇhā ("Mine"), we live with Diṭṭhi— Taṇhā (in turn), and the D.A. process continues. Turning around with it every day that leads to dizziness. Why do kamma arise controlled by diṭṭhi and clinging with diṭṭhi? It arises because of not putting effort into noble Dhamma (ariya-dhamma).

(Sayadaw starts to talk about the Devadūta Sutta) Heedfulness is ariya-dhamma. Heedlessness is wrong dhamma (micchā-dhamma). The four painful existences are related to heedless people. (This point is very important. Only in the Buddha Dhamma do we have the chance to become heedful people (i.e., appamāda person with appamāda dhamma). If you discern anicca thoroughly, you will be free from the dangers of apāyas. Therefore, practice it carefully. With ignorance (heedlessness), saṅkhāra comes to be; with heedfulness, saṅkhāra does not come to be, and one does not fall into apāyas. (Sayadaw described the sufferings of hell realms; see the sutta of Divine Messengers) These are the frightening results of heedlessness. (Sayadaw gave the instruction on contemplation of the mind.)

Observe the first mind (i.e., arising mind) with the following mind (i.e., contemplative mind or path factors mind). You’ll see its non-existence (i.e., anicca of the first citta).
