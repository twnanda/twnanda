:summary: Wholesome Kamma with Knowledge (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 

[This talk was given to a couple who came to stay with Sayadaw and practiced under his guidance.The husband first met Sayadaw and later introduced his wife to him.So here Sayadaw encouraged her in the practice.Later they gave up their business and very closed to Sayadaw until he passed away.The husband, U Kyaw Thein, knew his own death 6 months before.]

Desire of wanting to become a woman and will become a woman.To become a man and also the same.Has sharp knowledge (ñāṇa) or not is nothing to do with a man or a woman.It relates to your past lives when you were doing good kammas combined with ñāṇa or not.

To meet a good teacher and having good kammas with ñāṇa.These 2 factors are very important.These were mentioned in the Saṃyutta Nikāya.Associate with the wise can become a sotāpanna means that kamma is a different thing (Here Sayadaw emphasized the main point and not rejected the wholesome kammas).

The kammic results are related to kamma.To get Path and Fruition Knowledge are related to ñāṇaa.For example, the lay woman Visākhā became a noble person (sotāpanna) and her husband Punna was not.He had only good kamma and without ñāṇa.Again layman Visākha and his wife Dhammadinna both had good kamma and ñāṇa.

(Visākha was anāgāmin and Dhammadinna was arahant).(Sayadaw told the story of Vajira bhikkhuni encountered with Mara, the Tempter).Having samādhi and following with the knowledge are important.It’s nothing to do with as a man or a woman.

After that with the practice, going onwards with the 3 stages of knowledge.Today I’ll talk about the process of the practice; Intellectual understanding, Contemplation, Abandoning (study, practice and relization).For the intellectual understanding, can be measured is the body (rūpa) and can’t be measured is the mind (nāma).For the 4 mind aggregates have to contemplate the most prominent one.(e.g.if feeling – vedana is prominent, then contemplate vedana, etc.) 

Mind and body are arising together.If form arises, contemplate form (rūpa), and if mind arises, contemplate mind.Contemplate the most prominent one.For example, in a pot of soup, salt, oil, sweet, etc.are in there respectively.If the salt is prominent, you feel the salt more than the others.If form arises, know it as form.If mind arises, know it as mind.

For example, if you put your foot down, pathavi – earth elment is prominent and feel the heaviness.If you lift it, air element is prominent and feel lightness.If you are discerning anicca, it’s developing into insight.It’s Tirana pariññā − full understanding by contemplation.This knowledge is the most important.You have to know it thoroughly with the practice.

In this way contemplative knowledge become success.First discerning of arising and passing way, and then dissolution.After that developing into disenchantment.At that time don’t stop at it.If you stop it, knowledge will go down.

I am urging you to concentrate in the contemplation with the disenchantment.After that will develop the knowledge of watching it like an alien (i.e.sankharupekkha ñāṇa – knowledge of equanimity towards formations).

At that time watching it like an alien.It’ll appear as watching your own practical knowledge.These are knowledge of right seeing.It’s dukkha sacca – the truth of disgusting and useless.With continue contemplation and affection on the khandha with the self-view, falls away in a blip.From behind clinging and action with wrong views are cutting off.Why? 

Because of knowing dukkha sacca, khandha disappears and leaving behind with the contemplative mind (ñāṇa).And is not seeing dukkha anymore.Just only see dukkha nirodho – the cessation of dukkha.The cessation of dukkha is nirodha sacca.The Path Knowledge is called pahāna pariññā − abandoning with full understanding.

After the Path Knowledge ceases, 2 or 3 Fruition Knowledges arise.After they cease and reviewing knowledge arises.Reviewing as there is no dukkha anymore.This is reviewing dukkha, as not there.The Path Knowledge, Fruition Knowledge, Reviewing Knowledge all are seeing no dukkha.

If you see it in line (serially) and enter the stream (become sotāpanna).So these 3 knowledges are seeing Nibbāna.Because of their powers, the door to painful births are closed (i.e.Apaya bhūmi).
