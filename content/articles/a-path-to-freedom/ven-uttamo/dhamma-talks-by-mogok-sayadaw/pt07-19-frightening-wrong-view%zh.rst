:summary: Frightening Wrong View (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 5th December 1961

Wrong view comes from perception of self (atta saññā). What is the self (atta)? Taking each of the 5 khandhas as I and me. Because of the atta saññā and diṭṭhi arises. Where is the atta saññā coming from? If is from the unwise attention. Unwise attention comes from ignorance. Again ignorance comes from the hindrances (nivarana). 

These came from the Aṅguttara Nikāya. Nivarana → ignorance → unwise attention → self perception → view of inversion. Without separating the 5 khandhas into each separated group that see it as an object. Therefore we have to separate each one of them. Form can be shown in numbers. 

The other 4 nāma (mind) can’t. The wrong perception is coming from unwise attention, or no knowledge about it. Ignorance over controls it. Hindrances also over shadow on ignorance. Ignorance means not knowing the 4 Noble Truths. It’s wrong knowledge. Must make the self perception to not-self perception. 

Yesterday I had said that because of the khandha and wrong view arose. Wrong view is piercing or seeping in the khandha, and in each of them. Clinging to view exists until you have diṭṭhi. Attachment to view → action → painful birth (Ditthupādānaṁ → kammabhava → apāya jati) (Sayadaw gave the example of Prince Ajatasatthu). 

Urging him to kill his own father was this wrong view. Diṭṭhi and kilesa are decisive support conditions or causes (upanisaya). They can send beings to painful births (Sayadaw mentioned about the frightening of the Lohakhumbi Hell). Diṭṭhi is the root leader of the round of existence. It’s more fearful than taṇhā. With taṇhā still can arrive to blissful planes. 

Therefore in the 4 Path Knowledges, the coarset of all kilesa is diṭṭhi and firstly abandon by the Path Knowledge of the stream. (Sotāpatti magga). Between the 5 heavy kammas and diṭṭhi, when the world is near of the destruction beings can be free from the hells. (i.e. hell beings who had committed the 5 heavy kammas in hells) But hell beings who have fixed wrong view (niyata micchādiṭṭhi) move to another world system and continue to suffer in hells where no Buddha had been arisen.

Therefore spiritual friend is very important. You must know the form, feeling, etc as form, feeling. You know dukkha sacca as dukkha sacca. These become right attention. Not listening sacca dhamma, and cannot do the practice. Not doing the practice, and not becomes right view (because not seeing impermanence). 

Why the Brahma god could become a pig? Samatha practices can’t overcome diṭṭhi (A Brahma god can’t become a pig or any other animal by directly after death. But all worldings can take rebirths anywhere if they have the seed of diṭṭhi in their hearts). 

Knowing the khandha as the khandha becomes wise attention. Seeing impermanence become right view. Right view (sammā-diṭṭhi) arises and self view (atta diṭṭhi) or wrong view is running away. After ñāta pariññā (knowledge of mind/body) follow with tirana pariññā (knowledge of impermanence). 

After tirana pariññā ends and pahana pariññā arise (i.e. Nibbāna). Therefore the Buddha taught about 3 pariññā (understanding). With contemplation and after diṭṭhi falls away what happen? The body becomes light. By carrying along the hell seed body is too heavy. The contemplative mind becomes cool. 

The khandha also disappears. Not because it wants to be cool. Because diṭṭhi kilesa not exists. Therefore the apāya saṁsāra is no more related to this yogi (i.e. sotāpanna). Every time diṭṭhi arises and it builds the woeful planes. 

The practice process is: ① wise attention ② contemplation with knowledge ③ after many contemplations and the Path Knowledge will abandon the diṭṭhi builder. (it builds the planes of misery). 

If you have compassion to yourself should do the practice. Feeding the body, bathing the body, etc are not having compassion on oneself. These are becoming a slave to the khandha. Sending metta (loving kindness practice) also not a compassion to yourself. 

Because you can’t abandon diṭṭhi. In the future to hear these kinds of talk are not very easy. Even nowadays it become quite rare. Without listening of them diṭṭhi overwhelms people. When Path Knowledge arises khandha disappears. With the disappearance of the khandha where can diṭṭhi go and hide? Therefore during the dhamma interview I am asking you: “Does the khandha disappear?” Because the Buddha said that diṭṭhi was hiding in the khandha.
