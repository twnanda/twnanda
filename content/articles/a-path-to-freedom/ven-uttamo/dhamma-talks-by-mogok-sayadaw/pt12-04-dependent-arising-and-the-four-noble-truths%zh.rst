Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; no date noted

The Buddha was asking us to contemplate the internal phenomena to free from ageing, sickness and death. Aging means it is near to dying. You have the khandha that ageing and death come to be. You all are never searching for the faults of the khandha. Khandha is the cause of ageing and death. Therefore, it’s only leading to ageing and death however you are making adjustments and looking after. 

1. To know ageing and death is number one (i.e., to know dukkha sacca).

2. To know the cause of ageing and death is number two (i.e., to know Samudaya sacca) 

3. With the cessation of the five khandhas, ageing and death will cease.

4. By practicing for the cessation of the five Khandhas that ageing and death cease. (Numbers three and four are Nirodha and magga sacca). Then we know that without the five Khandhas is Nibbāna. If you contemplate or know how to think and the four Noble Truths will arise. You will also know the faults of the khandha.

You have to stay away from the horrible ageing and death. (i.e., to abandon.) You should not get it with prayers. You all are too silly because you don’t know these four points. (Common Buddhists have ignorance and bhava-taṇhā). The day when you know it and dukkha will be finished. 

(Continued the contemplation backwards/ paṭiloma by using the D.A. process.) Khandha arises because of craving. (i.e., samudaya and dukkha.) With the cessation of taṇhā, khandha will cease (i.e., the knowledge of knowing the cessation of dukkha / Nirodha sacca).

Khandha will cease if you can practice for the cessation of taṇhā. (i.e., the knowledge of magga sacca.) (Continue the contemplation backwardsly with these four points) Craving (taṇhā) arises because of the internal sense-bases (ajjhatta āyatana). You have to contemplate the six āyatana with insight. 

For example, taṇhā arises from the eye. It will get the khandha if taṇhā arises. With the khandha ageing, death will come. Not contemplating the eye as anicca, dukkha and anatta, taṇhā arises. Now you caught the culprit. You’re taking pleasure, appreciation and love on the eye that taṇhā arises. With it arises and will get the khandha. 

And ageing and death come to be. If you don’t know how to use the eye, ageing and death arise. Knowing how to use it will not arise. (Other āyatana also have to know in this way.) It’s clear to you that it is good without the khandha. (He talked about a great peta was living near the Ganges River and didn’t had the chances to drink water)

Whenever taṇhā not dies and beings are becoming the hungry corpses (i.e., die with taṇhā that always in hunger and thirst. This is taṇhā nature).
