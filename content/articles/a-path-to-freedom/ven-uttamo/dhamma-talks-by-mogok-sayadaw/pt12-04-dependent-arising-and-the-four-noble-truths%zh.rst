Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; no date noted

The Buddha was asking us to contemplate the internal phenomena to free from aging, sickness and death. Aging means it is near to dying. You have the khandha that aging and death come to be. You all are never searching for the faults of the khandha. Khandha is the cause of aging and death. Therefore however you are making adjustment and looking – after, it’s only leading to aging and death. 

1. To know aging and death is number one (i.e., to know dukkha sacca).

2. To know the cause of aging and death is number two(i.e., to know Samudaya sacca) 

3. With the cessation of the 5 khandhas, aging and death will cease.

4. By practicing for the cessation of the 5 Khandhas that aging and death cease. (Numbers 3 and 4 are Nirodha and magga sacca). Then we know that without the 5 Khandhas is Nibbāna. If you contemplate or know how to think and the 4 Noble Truths will arise. You will also know the faults of the khandha.

You have to be stayed away from the horrible aging and death. (i.e., to be abandoned) Should not get it with prayers. You all are too silly. (Common Buddhists have ignorance and bhava – tanhā). Because you don’t know these 4 points. The day when you know it and dukkha will be finished. 

(Continued the contemplation backwards/ patiloma by using the D.A. process). Because of craving and khandha arises. (i.e., samudaya and dukkha) with the cessation of tanhā and khandha will cease (i.e., the knowledge of knowing the cessation of dukkha./ Nirodha sacca).

If you can practice for the cessation of tanhā and khandha will cease. (i.e., the knowledge of magga sacca) (Continue the contemplation backwardsly with these 4 points) Because of the internal sense – bases (ajjhatta āyatana) and craving (tanhā) arises. You have to contemplate the 6 āyatana with insight. 

For example, tanhā arises from the eye. If tanhā arises and will get the khandha. With the khandha aging and death will come. Not contemplating the eye as anicca, dukkha and anattā that tanhā arises. Now you caught the culprit. You’re taking pleasure, appreciation and love on the eye that tanhā arises. With it arises and will get the khandha. 

And aging and death come to be. If you don’t know how to use the eye, aging and death arise. Knowing how to use it will not arise. (Other āyatana also have to know in this way.) It’s clear to you that without the khandha is good. (He talked about a great peta was living near the Ganges River and didn’t had the chances to drink water)

Whenever tanhā not dies and beings are becoming the hungry corpses (i.e., die with tanhā that always in hunger and thirst. This is tanhā nature).
