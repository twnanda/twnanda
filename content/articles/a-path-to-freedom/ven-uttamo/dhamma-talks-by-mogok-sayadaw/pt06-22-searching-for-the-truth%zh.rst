Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 2nd October 1961

Make the confirmation of what the khandha tells you. In saṁsāra, we were ending at what others said and swimming in the sea of dukkha. The khandha is changing in many ways and showing it to you. It will appear as nothing good in it. It is vanishing and replacing, vanishing and replacing on and on. 

Khandha is always in this way. By seeing this is getting the knowledge of knowing things as it really are (Yathabhūta Ñāṇa). Listen to the dhamma and turn the mind to the khandha. And the khandha will tell you that it has the characteristic of changing dukkha (viprinama lakkhanaṁ, dukkha saccaṁ). 

You have to follow it and know the changing and vanishing phenomena. After discern the beginning and will see its continuous process.

Except dukkha sacca, it has nothing. Is’t someone telling you or seeing with one’s own knowledge? The Buddha said it as “Dittha Dhammo” – dhamma seeing by oneself. He preferred the direct seeing (i.e. not like other faiths just believe). 

Before in the texts, it had said like this and that. Do you see it yourself? The text books had said these were ending at what others had said. You can’t reach Nibbāna with the text books and hearing from others. The real dukkha sacca is in the khandha. Man and woman are talking by people, but what you really see is impermanence. And then wrong view is falling away. 

Don’t be fear dangers (i.e. all dangers including man made and natural disasters). Khandha exists that dangers come in. Without khandha and it will not come. Without believe in what others say and turn the mind into the khandha. And will see the changing and vanishing. It only exists of the arising dukkha and vanishing dukkha. By turning towards the khandha and only find out disgusting and useless dukkha sacca. 

Concept and wrong view are disappeared. Perceiving what others said were concepts. Believed in what they had said were wrong view. With the D.A is more clearer. Perceive things were wrong views. It becomes growth is attachment to views (ditthupādāna). And then it becomes actions which are leading by wrong view. And continue to rebirth in the planes of misery. 


By seeing anicca the body concept of self disappears at that moment. (Sayadaw gave an example of a glass of water. He said holding a glass of water vertically. And then inclining it to a certain angle. And then go back to the vertical position. And then inclining it again. 

If you do this for many times and forget about the glass of water. Instead vertical and inclined positions are becoming clearer in the mind. Here, the glass of water is the body concept, the vertical and inclined positions are impermanence arising and vanishing). 

What the khandha has and ñāṇa knowing become fit in together (i.e. khandha is impermanent, so you see impermanence). All dukkha extincts because of the right seeing. (Sayadaw continued to talk about the importance and value of anicca as mentioned by the Buddha in the Aṅguttara Nikāya). From the right seeing and continue to develop the ending of right seeing. Changing is non-stopping and ñāṇa also observing. 

After knowing of its extreme situations and become the Nibbida Ñāṇa. From the disenchantment to develop not wanting it and become the Path Knowledge. It arises by cooling the heart. If you contemplate up to the point of not wanting it and the khandha disappears. 

Here the heart becomes cool is like putting down the very heavy burden load. Can contemplate whatever dhamma you prefer. And only seeing its changing and vanishing. Even the Buddha not exists anymore, but the main important thing is turning your mind to the object of contemplation (It doesn’t come by prayers and vows or meet the Buddha only).
