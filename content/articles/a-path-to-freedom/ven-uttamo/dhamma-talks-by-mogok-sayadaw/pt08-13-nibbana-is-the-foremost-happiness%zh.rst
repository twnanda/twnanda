:summary: Nibbāna is The Foremost Happiness (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 15th June 1962

Sayadaw based on the verses of the Buddha Kassapa which was mentioned in the Magandiya Sutta of the Majjima Nikāya, by the Buddha Gautama to Magandiya brahman."Freedom from disease: The foremost good fortune. Nibbāna: the foremost happiness."

But after hearing these verses, Magandiya responded that my body was healthy, so it was Nibbāna. Because these verses were existing in their Brahmin Teachings and handed down by their anscestors from the time of the Buddha Kassapa. They were using it and interpreting it wrongly (It’s very similar like later Buddhists using and interpreting the Buddha teaching in different ways).

Sayadaw said how could it that his body was healthy. With samādhi and observe this body, we can see their unhealthy nature directly, such as pains, itches, aches and changing, etc. In out daily life, we have to adjust and look after the body all the times. 

(Such as feeding it, clothing it, going to the toilet for many times a day. And then has to change postures all the times. Even in sleep turning it around to release its discomfort. There are 4 functions of dukkha sacca; Pilanatha-oppressive, Saṅkhatatha-conditioning, Santapatha-burning and Vipariṇāmatha changing. Among them Saṅkhatatha is quite extensive. Contemplation of this dukkha in daily is very important for practice). 

Where is the healthy nature of this body? Surely, the body is never healthy. The Buddha referred to this body as rogato (disease), ganthato (thorn), salato (dart), etc. With the ariyan eye (noble eye), sacca eye and will see it. Therefore, without this khandha is really healthy, the real fortune and the real happiness. 

The Buddha himself taught that the 5 khandhas were dukkha sacca. How can it be without disease and real happiness? The views of ariyan and worldly are quite different. Looking with the taṇhā and diṭṭhi eye and it seem healthy. If you fix with the ariyan eye and ñāṇa eye and looking at it, will see its as unhealthy. You’ll find the disease and knowing it as dukkha sacca.

The way of practice is; first, to approach a teacher; second, listening to the sacca dhamma; third, if you see the truth and will see the happy Nibbāna without the disease. With the practice, you’ll also know that the khandha has disease. With good samādhi and paññā will see its unhealthy nature and want to free from disease. Without seeing dukkha sacca and you can’t appreciate nirodha sacca. 

Only seeing the disease and you want to be cured. First have to discern the disease, later seeing its disenchantment and at last seeing its ending. And you’ll see Nibbāna without disease. If you have the khandha and always has the disease. Without it is Nibbāna Happiness.
