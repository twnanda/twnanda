Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 15th June 1962

Sayadaw based on the verses of the Buddha Kassapa which was mentioned in the Māgandiya Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya, taught by the Buddha Gautama to Māgandiya brahman (MN.75 Māgaṇḍiyasuttaṃ). ‘‘Freedom from disease: The foremost good fortune. Nibbāna: the foremost happiness. ’’ 

But after hearing these verses, Māgandiya responded that my body was healthy, so it was Nibbāna because these verses have been existed in their Brahmin Teachings and handed down by their ancestors from the time of the Buddha Kassapa. They were using it and interpreting it wrongly (It’s very similar like later Buddhists using and interpreting the Buddha teaching in different ways). 

Sayadaw said how it could be that his body was healthy. With samādhi and observe this body, we can see their unhealthy nature directly, such as pains, itches, aches and changing, etc. In our daily life, we have to adjust and look after the body all the times. 

(Such as: feeding it, clothing it, going to the toilet for many times a day. And then has to change postures all the times; even in sleep turning it around to release its discomfort. There are four functions of dukkha sacca; Pīḷanaṭṭha — oppressive, Saṅkhatatha — conditioning, Santāpatha — burning and Vipariṇāmatha — changing. Among them Saṅkhatatha is quite extensive. Contemplation of this dukkha in daily practice is very important for practice). 

Where is the healthy nature of this body? Surely, the body is never healthy. The Buddha referred to this body as rogato (disease), ganthato (thorn), sālāto (dart), etc. With the ariyan eye (noble eye), sacca eye and will see it. Therefore, without this khandha is really healthy, the real fortune and the real happiness. 

The Buddha himself taught that the five khandhas were dukkha sacca. How can it be without disease and real happiness? The views are quite different between ariyan and worldly. Looking with the taṇhā and diṭṭhi eye and it seem healthy. You will see it as unhealthy if you fix with the ariyan eye and ñāṇa eye and looking at it. You’ll find the disease and knowing it as dukkha sacca. 

The way of practice is; first, to approach a teacher; second, listening to the sacca dhamma; third, if you see the truth and will see the happy Nibbāna without the disease. With the practice, you’ll also know that the khandha has disease. With good samādhi and paññā will see its unhealthy nature and want to be free from disease. Without seeing dukkha sacca and you can’t appreciate nirodha sacca. 

Only see the disease and you want to be cured. At first, have to discern the disease, later seeing its disenchantment and at last seeing its ending. And you’ll see Nibbāna without disease. You always have the disease if you have the khandha. Without it, it is Nibbāna Happiness.
