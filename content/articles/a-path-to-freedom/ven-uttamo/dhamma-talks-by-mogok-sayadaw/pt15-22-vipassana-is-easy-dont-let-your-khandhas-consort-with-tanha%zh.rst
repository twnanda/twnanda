Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 9th July 1962

[This is the 3rd Dhamma talk given in Rangoon three months before he laid down his burdensome khandha.]

Your practice is finished by knowing the four truths simultaneously. You’ll know it through development by contemplation (bhāvetabba). Note that everyone has uncountable demerits (akusala kammas) within them.

People with debts, if they can’t repay them, will find them increasing (Mentioned are numerous kammas in everyday life from the six sense doors in every moment. With the knowledge of D.A teaching, it’s very frightening to know why the Buddha emphasized that the permanent homes of living beings are the four apāyas.)

Don’t be with the wrong consort. Don’t consort with Taṇhā but rather consort with Saddha and Paññā (conviction and wisdom). [Sayadaw explains the differences between these two consorts using the D.A Chart process. These are anuloma and paṭiloma processes or saṁsāra and Nibbāna.]

Don’t let the khandhas consort with Taṇhā. Let the khandhas consort with Saddha and Paññā. You should believe only in what the Buddha taught about the khandhas but don’t believe it blindly (i.e., like other beliefs with no standard measures). This becomes true conviction (Saddha). Only those with true conviction and wisdom can follow behind it. (with blind faiths only ignorance and delusion follow behind them). A khandha arising from the five khandhas should be noted as dukkha sacca. Don’t neglect (turning your back towards the arising) the arising dhamma but know it with Saddha and paññā. This knowing (knowledge) is very important! The salvaging Dhamma (the real Saviour) is this knowledge of Dhamma. Knowing of the arising mind with the following mind is knowing the dead one (mind) with the living one (mind). Therefore, vipassanā means observing the dead one with the living one. Vipassanā is easy! Using it with the letters (words) can be confusing. Knowing of your own death with this knowledge is called insight (vipassanā). The reason a not difficult thing becomes difficult is that teachers can’t give the necessary method. With the necessary method, you don’t need to waste your time.

Dying is dukkha sacca and knowing it many times (bhāvetabba) is magga sacca. This is vipassanā. You only know about sending other corpses to the cemetery but don’t know that you are always dying. The Khandha is the Forest Monastery and Mountain Monastery. The real forest and mountain monasteries are meant for the Samatha Practices. Abhidhamma method and Suttanta method are different. For example – a seeing mind arises, as soon as seeing arises and with the contemplation no choice for good or bad arises. Choosing things for good ones and bad ones is influenced by Taṇhā.

If you contemplate what is existing and it becomes constant or stable, a sassata wrong view arises. Contemplating the non-existence of it will free you from sassata wrong view. It’ll never become vipassanā if you see only the living one with the living one. Dukkha sacca discusses the death of the mind (feeling, form, etc., are also understood this way).

(There are profound meanings behind the expositions of Sayadaw’s talks.)

Every arising dhamma is ehi-passiko – it calls to you, saying: “Come! Contemplate me.” If you do not contemplate it, “Don’t you want to go to Nibbāna?” Even if you want to go with taṇhā, e.g., there is an itch and you follow it with the hand. (Here, Sayadaw’s talk becomes humorous). Sandiṭṭhiko – follow it with the seeing of your own knowledge. You are using it as worshipping the Dhamma that does not lead to Nibbāna. (It becomes Dhammānussati – Reflection on Qualities of Dhamma). If you look in the vipassanā books, it’s a long one. The main point is only that much. Akāliko – it gives you the result instantly. (because – taṇhā, upādāna, kamma do not arise). If you’re following behind the Calling, you will attain Nibbāna.
