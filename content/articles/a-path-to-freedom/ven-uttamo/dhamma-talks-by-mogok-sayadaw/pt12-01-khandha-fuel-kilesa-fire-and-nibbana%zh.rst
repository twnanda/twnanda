Someone discerns impermanence is near to the Nibbāna element. If the causes are ready for him and it’ll will change instantly. These were mentioned by the Buddha in the Udana Pali. No – one was asking him about them. But he himself was wanting the monks to know it. It was not teaching for a particular person. 

Whatever khandha we have it, starts from not knowing (ignorance/avijjā). However, after you get it, and everyday becoming not good is true indeed. (Mentioned some of the everday saṅkhāra dukkha. These are really heavy burdened dukkha. Always living with delusion (moha) that human beings are not aware of it. 

Even they fall in love with saṅkhāra dukkha.) By feeding and looking after it will never give you any benefit and satisfaction. Nothing is good will happen, instead only dukkha is increasing. You may think human life is good to have it. Yes, it’s better than animals. Except it has the chance to end dukkha than nothing is good about it.

(In millions of Buddhists how many of them really practice. No need to mention about non – Buddhist, the outsiders) 

You’re taking the fuel as a lump of gold. Khandha is like fuel and kilesa is fire. The eleven kinds of fire are encircling the khandha and burning with it. Thirty – one realms of existence are like big fire. Without the cessation of ignorance and volitional formation (avijjā, saṅkhāra) by changing the realms of existence as fuels. And then burn with the fire of defilements.

Only with the extinction of fuel and fire will have peace. If dukkha exists and then sukha also must exist. Not arriving there is because of not knowing how to go there. Taking pleasure in burning with fire is ignorant pleasure (nutty human beings). Practising insight is expelling the defilements hidden in the khandha. 

Then it’s the extinguisher of the kilesa fire. Only by using the path of holy water that kilesa fire will die out. There must be a place existed with the fire and fuel are extinct. With fuel and fire together beings are wandering in the 31 realms of existence with shame and disadvantage. We are looking for bodies for the funeral invitations. 

The Buddha taught in the Udana Pali that the place of Nibbāna where the fuel and fire had been extinguished was really existing. I told you because it had been experienced by myself. Atthi bhikkhave ajātaṁ, abhutaṁ, asaṅkhataṁ, etc. Monks! There is an existing of an unborn, unbecome, unconditioned, etc. 

Not knowing is avijjā, and tanhā is taking pleasure in things. We’re with ignorance and taking pleasure in the fuel and fire. With the cessation of both and the right knowing arises. This body is conditioned phenomena (saṅkhata dhamma) and arising by kamma, citta, utu and āhāra. Starting from the exit of saṅkhata (conditioned) will arrive to the asaṅkhata (unconditioned). 

Saṅkhata and saṅkhāra are the same meaning. Mind phenomena (nāma dhamma) are the cause of sense objects and sense doors (aroms and dvaras). Therefore any one of the mind and body (nāma and rūpa) phenomena are not making by us. (Also not by the Creator)

The Buddha said; sabbe saṅkhāra anicca – therefore mind and body only have impermanence. Arising is saṅkhāra and dissolution is anicca. If you’re discerning impermanence and finding out the exit. If, becoming disenchanted, and you are ready for stepping out from the exit. If not wanting the saṅkhāra dukkha and mind/body disappear and asaṅkhāta Nibbāna arises.
