:summary: Selfishness Deceiving as Equanimity (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 26th February 1959

Some people sometimes using language like equanimity, but including selfishness and anger. Equanimity means seeing all living beings in equilibrium according to their own kammas. By checking the nature of the language and the voice can know true equanimity or not. Envy (issa), selfishness (macchariya), dosa (anger), worry & remorse (kukkucca) can combine together. In seeing just seeing only, in hearing just hearing only…etc. become equanimity (upekkhā). Whatever arising just knowing it arising or contemplating impermanence. If you don’t know about these will become ignorance (avijjā). (There is a Burmese word came from the Pali word upekkhā. Its meaning is indifferent. Here Sayadaw referred to this kind of upekkhā as selfishness and anger.)
