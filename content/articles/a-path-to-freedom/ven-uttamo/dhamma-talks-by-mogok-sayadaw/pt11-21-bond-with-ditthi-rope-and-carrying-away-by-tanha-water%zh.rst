:summary: Bond with Diṭṭhi Rope and Carrying Away by Tanhā Water (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; no date noted

Before contemplating diṭṭhi with vipassanā; it’s necessary to clear away its influence beforehand. If you have the I/me and then you have mine. Therefore if you have diṭṭhi and tanhā will follow. Diṭṭhi is binding a person and tanhā river/water carrying him down stream. 

Therefore even he is seeing the river bank and can’t climb up on it. Even though tanhā water carrying him down towards the 4 woeful planes, because of bound with diṭṭhi rope and can’t free himself from it. We were carrying away randomly by tanhā water in the whole saṁsāra. We’ll encounter with big waves and whirl pools. 

The 5 sense objects were floods (ogha). Therefore you have to be sunk in them. The whirlpool is also pulling you in and sinking you down. Here you don’t need to be afraid of the flood and tanhā. You have to be fear of bound with the diṭṭhi rope. Therefore the Buddha said that diṭṭhi was very important. 

D.A. process makes you sink and sensual objects make you in dizziness. Tanhā is carrying you away down there. Diṭṭhi makes you without energy and power. It was also making you missed with the Buddha and the Dhamma. If you conquer diṭṭhi and tanhā also not having the power to carry you away. 

Also you are not going into the whirlpool and flood. And there is no more sinking in the D.A. process. Therefore diṭṭhi is very important. It opposes the good and holy dhammas. It was for this reason that the Buddha taught us to abandon diṭṭhi first by giving the similes of head on fire and the inflicting by spears. 

Wholesome dhammas can give the result of Nibbāna as supportive conditions. But we don’t attain it because of mixing up with diṭṭhi. If you are making merits for the purpose of Nibbāna, then don’t mix up with diṭṭhi.

(Sayadaw continued for dispelling diṭṭhi with the 5 khandhas). Viewing the khandha wrongly as a living being is diṭṭhi. Bound with its rope strongly and can’t take it off is ditthupādāna – clinging the 5 khandhas as me. If this diṭṭhi is not falling off and not free from the 4 woeful planes.

Showing with the D.A. process; ditthupādāna → kamma → painful birth. And the Buddha continued to say that if diṭṭhi had been fallen off and freed from the 4 woeful planes. Therefore diṭṭhi has to be fallen away. The reason diṭṭhi arises from the 5 khandhas is not clear about the samuti sacca and the pramattha sacca – conventional and ultimate truths. 

(For this point, Sayadaw gave the example of a woman who was becoming with sorrow lamentation, pain and grief with the death of her husband) This comes from not understanding about these 5 truths. The reason is overcoming by the conventional truth. 

The 5 khandhas are disappearing for her and becoming sorrow, lamentation, and crying as I have lost my husband. This is crying for the non – existing thing. Crying for the atta – the husband. Her non – existence husband was disappearing. This is the most difficult thing to deal with. (Worldlings are really in the state of super – craziness. Ariyans’ll laugh amusingly by pressing their bellies). 

You all were in the whole saṁsāra had troubles, difficulties and died. And all were oppressing and tormenting by the non – existing things. Beaten with the non – existing stick, in reality can never die (But people die with sorrow, lamentation, pain and grief by the non – existing things). 

If you are wanting to strip off diṭṭhi must clear about the 5 khandhas. Also have to clear about samuti and paramattha. There were 8 causes to teach on conventional truths. And for the ultimate truths had 3 causes (i.e., 3 universal characteristics). Teaching samuti for the sake of shame and fear of wrong doings (hiri and ottapa dhammas), etc. 

Not knowing the 5 khandhas analytically and penetratingly, and diṭṭhi will not fall off. There are 3 kinds of analytical and penetrative knowledges/knowing. These are; ñāta pariññā, tirana pariññā and pahana pariññā respectively (i.e., knowledges of theory, practice and result).
