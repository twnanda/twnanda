Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; no date noted

[There were 4 warnings from the Buddha. These were: 

① The body is not following our own desires, but with aging, sickness and death. These are its nature. It’s leading towards aging, sickness and death. The yogi is practicing to escape from aging, illness and death. 

② When dukkha vedanā arises in the khandha and we can’t rely on anyone. Nobody can give us comfort. We’re practicing for refuge or reliable dhamma to counter feeling (vedanā). And it’ll give us comfort. 

③ Whatever fortunes we have by hard working, none of these are ours. If we die and have to leave everything behind with the corpses (Even our physical bodies are not belonging to us and no need to talk about external things). Practicing dhamma is making it becoming ours 

④ Tanhā is asking you to do anything, never giving you satisfaction and also never ending. We’re practicing dhamma to free ourselves as slaves from tanhā. We need to contemplate them very often.]

In the Aṅguttara Nikāya, the Buddha taught the monks to reflect on these 4 points of dhamma. ① This khandha is always leading towards aging, sickness and death. Therefore the khandha’s nature and our desires are different. It done its duties. Our duties are to escape from it. 

Practicing dhamma is to escape from the future aging, sickness and death. To escape from the 4 painful births (hell, animal, ghost, etc.) Saying with one word to escape from all future dukkha. Before the practice we should reflect on this point. With this purpose to encourage and inspire/uplift our spirits. 

② When sickness and disease arise (all the physical and mental unpleasant feelings) and family members (wife, children, relatives, etc.) can’t do anything for us. All are only in confusion, and can’t rely on anyone. And nobody can give you comfort. Therefore practicing dhamma is searching for refuge and comfort. With this in mind and must practice hard. Feeling is mind dhamma (nāma). 

Therefore who can help you? ③ Gold, silver and wealths are not your own properties. Therefore we have to practice for Nibbāna and it’ll become our own properties. Practicing dhamma is freeing ourselves as the slave of tanhā. Working for tanhā will be never finished.

If you’re not free yourself from birth, aging and death and making dukkha sacca as your own property (no.①). We got the khandhas which are unreliable and give us no refuge. Practicing dhamma is searching for refuge and reliability (no.②). Everything we have been searched with greed are not our own properties.

These ways of searching are wrong. All these things will perish and disappear. Only Nibbāna is our own property and can’t be perishable. ④ Whatever you’re doing is for tanhā. If you’re not wanting to practice dhamma and having the mind of a slave. 

Whatever you’re doing for tanhā is liking to fill a water pot with holes in it. This is the working of a blind person. It’s not the fault of tanhā but the one filling it. Another point is whatever you fill from the mouth into the body and it comes out again from the eyes, ears, noses, mouth and body. 

So you can never fill it up (If we contemplate this point and can see human beings are quite funny and foolish. In our whole life, we’re feeding the body by working hard. And whatever coming out from it are stinking, disgusting and useless – asubha). Only by thinking carefully and will release its nature. Even not only has no satisfaction with one’s body holes but also we’re filling for the family members. Therefore practicing dhamma is freeing ourselves from the slavery of the mind.

Let’s continue our yesterday dhamma on cause and effect connection. We have birth, aging and death and falling into woeful planes; all these things happen because of the existence of the khandhas. If you’re afraid of these things must abandon greed (lobha). 

Firstly, have to abandon wrong view and doubt. Only can abandon it before that can abandon lobha. By abandoning lobha can abandon all dukkha. Wrong view and doubt are latent in the 5 khandhas. To abandon it has to be in the right way (sammā – patipadā). Following accordingly to the D.A. processes are the wrong ways (miccha – padipadā). 

If ñāṇa comes in and becomes (sammā – patipadā). You’re afraid of birth, aging and death. This is the fear of an animal. (e.g, throwing a stone at a dog and it fears of the stone) You’re fear of the result. You have to be afraid of the cause which is the wrong way (miccha – padipadā). If you’re afraid of aging, sickness and death do not let it becomes miccha – padipadā. The task of impermanence is the right way (sammā – padipadā).
