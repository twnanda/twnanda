:summary: The Important of Anicca (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; (no date)

You all have been listened to dhammas (Suññāta dhammas, sacca dhammas etc.).You understand them, and also have seen impermanence.With the cessation of contact (phassa) and feeling (vedana) ceases.For example, bitten by mosquito and become itchy.Bitten by mosquito is contact and itchy is feeling.

Phassa paccaya vedana – contact conditions feeling.No mosquito bites you and the itch also ceases.Phassa nirodha vedana nirodho – with the cessation of contact and feeling also ceases.With the cause conditions and result arises.With the cause ceases and the result also ceases.

You have to understand these things without any doubt.Then your wrong view falls away.Even though you die with the painful feelings – dukkha vedana and no need to be afraid of it.Because during your practice, wrong views and doubt fall away.You get the purification of view and doubt (diṭṭhivisuddhi and kankhāvitarana visuddhi).

It was falling away with the insight knowledge.Still not with the Path Knowledge yet.When you are seeing impermanence, the body not disappears.Only with the cessation of impermanence and the body will disappear.Wrong view and doubt are the 2 dhammas send being to painful births.

Therefore, I advise you to die courageously near death (i.e.discerning impermanence with practice).Yesterday talk I was leaving this point.So today I am adding it here. (Yesterday Sayadaw gave a talk based on the Sotanugati sutta of Aṅguttara Nikāya.)

Today I’ll continue to talk from the Saṃyutta Nikāya.Why the Buddha entered into parinibbāna (i.e.passing away)? Because his direct disciples were not left anymore (i.e.Buddha’s Veyneyyas) (From the Pañcavaggi – the first 5 disciples to his last disciple Subhadda were only needed his direct helps).

But there are still people with their teachers (This is also one of the reasons the Teaching still exists).It’s necessary for you to have ears to listen and have someone to teach you.Near the end of his passing away, the Buddha reminded us that mind and body dhammas were having the nature of arising and passing away.Therefore, don’t forget them.

I also teach impermanence.The Buddha taught them for 45 years.Only by seeing impermanence can realize Nibbāna.Impermanence is dukkha sacca.By penetrating of dukkha sacca, realize Nibbāna.Your body is also impermanent.If you looking at the 31 realms of existence, will see impermanence.Not seeing impermanence is like a blind person.Your reliable dhamma is impermanence.

If you discern impermanence very well, will realize Nibbāna in this life.If this not happen, will be sure in next life.The Buddha gave this guarantee in the sutta in the Aṅguttara Nikāya.If you discern impermanence, greed, hatred, and delusion never arise.The Buddha never taught as anicca paccaya lobha, dosa, moha – impermanence conditions greed, hatred, and delusion.

If you are discerning impermanence, become jhāna paccayo and magga paccayo.It has the 5 path factors = 3 samādhi factors + 2 paññā factors.If you do only jhāna, no wisdom factors.By doing paññā and is including jhāna.The practice I teach you include jhāna and paññā together.Every vipassanā contemplation, jhāna and magga are together.Outside the Buddha teaching (sāsanā) only jhāna exists.Inside the sāsanā, don’t do this only.

Jhāna and magga have to be conbined.Someone practices jhāna stabilize the object of contemplation.For the asubha object (loathsomeness) not let the asubha disappears.For the pathavi object (earth) not let the pathavi disappears.Therefore, jhāna itself not leads to Nibbāna is clear.

The way of jhāna and magga together were mentioned in the Saṃyutta and Aṅguttara Nikāya as yugananda way.Jhāna is samatha and magga is vipassanā.Samatha has to straighten it.And vipassanā has to discern it.In the 5 jhanic factors not include magga.Straighten the mind towards vanishing phenomenon is jhāna.And to discern its vanishing is ñāṇa (ñāna).It’s the way of jhāna and ñāṇa.

In front is arising and vanishing.And following behind is jhāna and magga.What is the benefit of discerning anicca? It is moving out kilesa.If not seeing impermanence, the mind is latent with kilesa.Devadatta had swallowed by the earth was heavy with kilesa.Not because he was fat.Your khandha boat is heavy with kilesa.You have to cut out the kilesa for its lightness.

In this way your khandha boat will become light and can cross over the taṇhā river to the other shore.I am urging you every day to contemplate impermanence.Because I am worrying that you’ll be swallowed by earth.Do you have any pity for yourself? Except this job, there is no other work can free from it.The Buddha taught the way with samadhi and follow with paññā.
