:summary: Correct One’s Mistakes in Time (Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw-- Emptiness, Conditioned, and Unconditioned.)

Dhamma Talks by Mogok Sayadaw; 18th December 1960

The Buddha said, one could know in 2 ways for one’s wholesome and unwholesome kammas one had done before. These were doing kammas still alive and near death mental signs arose. If you want to correct them at present is the best way. Before death it can be done. Near death some can do it and some can’t correct them. Near death generally people can’t make the corrections. 

Now, if you want to correct them still can do it. In this way and near death you don’t need it. In the Aṅguttara Nikāya, the Buddha warned us that we should not take it as I had done unwholesome kamma and nobody knew it. At least you know it yourself. You have to correct them quickly. 

If you die before, even though it has the 5000 years of Buddha Sāsanā, and your own sāsanā is disappeared (Buddhists should take this point seriously). Don’t count the Buddha Sāsanā with years. Make the counting with your own death. Man, only has the life span of one mind. If one of the breathing in and out mind is not arising and becomes dead. 

What already has passed nothing to do with you. Next year also nothing to do with you. Sāsanā depending on your life span. Only you can cut off the D.A. process and seeing impermanent is your own sāsanā. If you are choosing time for tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is a fool. 

Today I have no time and not doing it. I will do it tomorrow is sassata ditthi. Sassata here is tomorrow I will still alive. It means it doesn’t die. Choosing days and hours is by sassata. If you are glad with the forbidden dhamma which send beings to painful births and then you’ll finish. Forbidden the Path Knowledge. is wrong view. In the whole of saṁsāra beings are hindered by it. 

We were climbing up from the 4 woeful planes with difficulties (Some Buddhists might think we had good times in saṁsāra. We should go and have a check with the suttas in the Pali Nikāya, what the Buddha had said about it). Now, you know that ditthi is the biggest enemy.

(Sayadaw told a story in the Majjima Nikāya, how tanhā – ditthi hindered a man for realization. In the Kassapa Buddha’s time, a layman named Peya because of ditthi – tanhā missed the chance for Path and Fruition Knowledges. If he continued to listen for sometimes would enter the stream. But he had to wait until the Gautama Buddha’s time for realization. It was quite a long period of time.)

The Buddha taught 3 principles for sure realization. (Sayadaw talked about the Governing Principles (adipati) from the Anguttara Nikāya.

| 1. Self as a governing principle (attadipati)
| 2. Cosmos as a governing principle (lokadipati)
| 3. Dhamma as a governing principle ( Dhammadipati)
| 

1. Taking oneself as a governing principle. 2. Taking others as a governing principle 3. Taking the qualities of Dhamma as a governing principle. ① I am not practicing for the sake of the 4 requisites nor for the fortunes of future births. But to be freed from the dangers of birth, ageing, sickness and death, etc. We can’t realize it with the practice for the desire of sensuality and becoming – bhavatanhā. You should not have your own desire in the practice. You can’t practice with desire.

2. If kilesa comes in or many thoughts arise and admonish oneself. And contemplate the impermanence of whatever mind state arises. Admonish oneself as there are unseen beings watching at me (e.g, devatas, monks have psychic abilities, etc.).

3. During the practice if worldly mental states come in and contemplate the Qualities of Dhamma, admonish oneself with it. (Sayadaw talked about the Dhamma is calling at you and also passes away. Therefore if you go with the calling and seeing death. The calling is arising, with the going and not seeing it is vanishing.

Anyone going with the calling will find out its impermanence. There are also wrong goings. For e.g., mosquito bites and going with the hand (bang!) This is going with anger (dosa). Therefore you must go with knowledge. It’s sure that it’ll become non – temporal – akāliko.
