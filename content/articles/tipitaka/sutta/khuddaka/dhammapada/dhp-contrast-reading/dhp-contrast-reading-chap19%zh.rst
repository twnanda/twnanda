.. [MettFn19-05] 〔明法尊者註19-05〕 有一天，約三十位阿蘭若比丘前來向佛陀頂禮。佛陀明白他們證得阿羅漢果的機緣已經成熟，就問他們︰「你們進來的時候，有沒有看見一位上座？」他們說︰「沒有看見。」「你們怎麼沒有看見？」「大德！我們看見一位沙彌。」「他不是沙彌，是上座吧？」「大德！他是很小的。」佛陀說：「諸比丘！他不是沙彌，而是上座。我不因為人的歲數大就稱他作上座，任何人究竟明白四聖諦，而且不傷害別人，才是上座。」

.. [NāradaFn19-01] (Ven. Nārada 19-01) Kāyena - that is, nāmakāyena, through the mental body, or, in other words, through self-realization.

.. [NāradaFn19-02] (Ven. Nārada 19-02) Thera - a term applied to those bhikkhus who have counted at least ten years in the Order from the date of their higher ordination. Thera, literally, means one who is firm or stable.

.. [NāradaFn19-03] (Ven. Nārada 19-03) Saccaṃ - the four noble truths.

.. [NāradaFn19-04] (Ven. Nārada 19-04) Dhammo - the nine supramundane states.

.. [NāradaFn19-05] (Ven. Nārada 19-05) Saññamo - morality and sense-restraint.

.. [NāradaFn19-06] (Ven. Nārada 19-06) By means of the four Paths.

.. [NāradaFn19-07] (Ven. Nārada 19-07) He who does not practise higher morality (sīla) and austerities (dhutāṅga).

.. [NāradaFn19-08] (Ven. Nārada 19-08) Bhikkhu, literally, means "he who begs" but bhikkhus do not beg. They silently stand at the door for alms. They live on what is spontaneously given by the supporters. See note on v. 31.

.. [NāradaFn19-09] (Ven. Nārada 19-09) Vissaṃ dhammaṃ = visamaṃ dhammaṃ, vissaṃ gandhaṃ vā kāyakammādikaṃ dhammaṃ (Commentary). Vissaṃ has two meanings (1) whole or all, and (2) bad smell. The Commentary gives only the latter in this case.

                    "He is not a mendicant simply because he begs others (for alms). He who adopts the whole law is a mendicant, not he who adopts only a part". Radhakrishnan.

                    The context makes the verse clear. The brahmin who had adopted the ascetic life claimed the right to be called a bhikkhu simply because he begged his food as is the custom of the disciples of the Buddha although he did not observe the other practices of a bhikkhu.

                    Vissaṃ dhammaṃ could therefore be interpreted as "the whole code of morality pertaining to the life of a bhikkhu".

.. [NāradaFn19-10] (Ven. Nārada 19-10) Such as morality, concentration, wisdom, etc.

.. [NāradaFn19-11] (Ven. Nārada 19-11) That is, for having embraced the best and abandoned evil.

.. [NāradaFn19-12] (Ven. Nārada 19-12) Internal and external Aggregates.

.. [NāradaFn19-13] (Ven. Nārada 19-13) The four kinds of higher morality observed by bhikkhus and the thirteen kinds of higher ascetic practices (dhutāṅga) (Commentary).

.. [NāradaFn19-14] (Ven. Nārada 19-14) That is, the Tipitaka (Commentary).

.. [NāradaFn19-15] (Ven. Nārada 19-15) Anāgāmi stage (Commentary).

.. [NāradaFn19-16] (Ven. Nārada 19-16) Faith in existence (Commentary). "Have a care", Mrs. Rhys Davids.

.. [NāradaFn19-17] (Ven. Nārada 19-17) That is, Arahantship.

.. [ThaniSFn-V256-257] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 256-257) The sense of the verse, confirmed by DhpA, suggests that the Pali word dhammattho means "judge." This, in fact, is the theme tying together the verses in this chapter. The duty of a judge is to correctly determine attha, a word that denotes both "meaning" and "judgment," these two senses of the word being connected by the fact that the judge must interpret the meanings of words used in rules and principles to see how they correctly apply to the particulars of a case so that he can pass a correct verdict. The remaining verses in this chapter give examples of interpreting attha in an appropriate way.

.. [ThaniSFn-V259] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 259) "Sees Dhamma through his body": The more common expression in the Pali Canon (e.g., in AN 6.46 and AN 9.45) is to touch Dhamma through or with the body (phusati or phassati, "he touches," rather than passati, "he sees"). The Sanskrit recensions and the Patna Dhp all support the reading, "he would touch," but all Pali recensions are unanimous in the reading, "he sees." Some scholars regard this latter reading as a corruption of the verse; I personally find it a more striking image than the common expression.

.. [ThaniSFn-V265] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 265) This verse plays with a number of nouns and verbs related to the adjective sama, which means "even," "equal," "on pitch," or "in tune." Throughout ancient cultures, the terminology of music was used to describe the moral quality of people and acts. Discordant intervals or poorly-tuned musical instruments were metaphors for evil; harmonious intervals and well-tuned instruments, for good. Thus in Pali, samana, or contemplative, also means a person who is in tune with the principles of rightness and truth inherent in nature. Here and in 388, I've attempted to give a hint of these implications by associating the word "contemplative" with "consonance."

.. [ThaniSFn-V268-269] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 268-269) This verse contains the Buddhist refutation of the idea that "those who know don't speak, those who speak don't know." For another refutation of the same idea, see DN 12. In Vedic times, a sage (muni) was a person who took a vow of silence (mona) and was supposed to gain special knowledge as a result. The Buddhists adopted the term muni, but redefined it to show how true knowledge was attained and how it expressed itself in the sage's actions. For a fuller portrait of the ideal Buddhist sage, see AN 3.23 and Sn 1.12.

.. [ThaniSFn-V271-272] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 271-272) This verse has what seems to be a rare construction, in which na + instrumental nouns + a verb in the aorist tense gives the force of a prohibitive ("Don't, on account of x, do y"). "The renunciate ease that run-of-the-mill people don't know," according to DhpA, is the state of non-returning, the third of the four stages of Awakening (see note 22). Because non-returners are still attached to subtle states of becoming on the level of form and formlessness, DhpA drives home the message that even non-returners should not be complacent by paraphrasing a passage from AN 1 (202 in the Thai edition; at the end of Chapter 19 in the PTS edition) that reads, "Just as even a small amount of excrement is foul-smelling, in the same way I do not praise even a small amount of becoming, even for the extent of a fingersnap."

.. [VaradoFn-V266] (Ven. Varado V.266) Verse 266: "A bhikkhu is one who commits/ To the whole of the training, not bits" (vissaṃ dhammaṃ samādāya bhikkhu hoti na tāvatā). PED (vissaṃ): all, every, entire. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V256] (DLMBS Commentary V256) Some monks were returning from Sāvatthi after their almsround. Because there was a heavy rain, they took a shelter in a hall of justice. While there, they observed the judges deciding the cases very quickly after having taken bribes. 

    The monks later reported the matter to the Buddha who told them this verse (and the following one, DhP 257).

.. [DLMBSFn-V257] (DLMBS Commentary V257) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 257). 

    It is very easy to judge others, to point out others' mistakes or bad qualities. Therefore we have to be very thorough when we have to judge others. We have to listen to every possible point of view; we have to look at the problem from all angles. Only then can we be able to judge according to truth and we can call ourselves "righteous".

.. [DLMBSFn-V258] (DLMBS Commentary V258) A group of monks always caused troubles in the monastery. Wherever they went, some problems occurred. Once they boasted in front of some novices, saying only they were wise and intelligent. 

    When the Buddha heard about this, he replied with this verse, saying that one should not be called wise only because one talks a lot. Only one who is peaceful and free from hate can be called wise.

.. [DLMBSFn-V259] (DLMBS Commentary V259) A monk named Ekudāna lived alone in the forest. He knew by heart only one verse of the Dharma, but he fully understood its meaning. Whenever he would recite the verse, the guardian spirits of the forest would applaud. 

    At one occasion, two learned monks with many disciples came to that place. They asked Ekudāna of there were many beings that wished to learn the Dharma. Ekudāna told them about the spirits applauding every time the Dharma was spoken. The two monks they took turns preaching the Dharma but when they finished, the guardian spirits did not applaud at all. Therefore they started to doubt Ekudāna’s words. But Ekudāna simply recited the verse he knew and immediately the spirits started to applaud. 

    The two monks returned to Sāvatthi and reported the matter to Buddha. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that in understanding the Dharma, quality is much more important than quantity. To remember only one verse, but understanding it fully is far better than remembering all the Buddha’s words but not actually grasping their meaning.

.. [DLMBSFn-V260] (DLMBS Commentary V260) A group of monks came to see the Buddha. Because he knew they were very close to attaining the Awakenment, he asked them if they had seen an Elder just entering the room. The monks replied they did not see an Elder, only a young novice. The Buddha replied that this monk was actually not a novice, but an Elder. He further told them this verse (and the following one, DhP 261). 

    The monks all attained the Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V261] (DLMBS Commentary V261) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 260). 

    Wisdom cannot be measured by age. One who is old is not necessarily wise. Sometimes a young person can be far wiser than somebody old. To grow old is not a virtue demanding automatic respect. We should save our respect for those who deserve it. People, who understand the Buddha's teaching deeply, and act accordingly, are to be respected, be they young or old.

.. [DLMBSFn-V262] (DLMBS Commentary V262) The elder monks usually had some young novices as their students. It was custom that these novices would attend on their teachers, wash their robes, get water for them to drink and other small services. Some monks who had no students started to envy these elders. So they suggested to the Buddha that the novices should have more teachers to receive more guidance. Of course, the Buddha knew their real motive (to get some work done by the novices) so he refused this. He further admonished the monks by this verse (and the following one, DhP 263).

.. [DLMBSFn-V263] (DLMBS Commentary V263) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 262). 

    One, who wants to be respected, should discard all the impurities and clean one's mind. It is not possible to be envious, hating and selfish and expect others to respect us. To try to hide it away under the mask of nice words and smiling face maybe can fool somebody, but only for a short while. Then everybody will see the true face and their respect for us will quickly evaporate.

.. [DLMBSFn-V264] (DLMBS Commentary V264) There was a monk named Hatthaka. He liked to argue with others. If he was defeated in an argument, he challenged his opponent to meet again at a specified place and time. Hatthaka would get to the place before the appointed time and would declare that the absence of his opponent means he acknowledges his defeat. Therefore he would boast he won the argument.
    When the Buddha heard about this, he admonished Hatthaka by this verse (and the following one, DhP 265).

.. [DLMBSFn-V265] (DLMBS Commentary V265) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 264). 

    To be a monk is not easy. Just to wear the monk's robe and have one's head shaven is certainly not enough. If a monk lacks discipline and resolve, then he is not to be called a monk. Only after having met and conquered evils, greed, desire and others, and with firm self-discipline, is one truly a monk.

.. [DLMBSFn-V266] (DLMBS Commentary V266) There was a brahmin, who had the habit of going on almsround begging for almsfood, just as the Buddha's monks did. Therefore, he thought he was also to be called a monk. He went to see the Buddha and told him this idea. The Buddha reprimanded him with this verse (and the following one, DhP 267).

.. [DLMBSFn-V267] (DLMBS Commentary V267) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 266). 

    A true monk is not the one who wears monk's robes and gets his almsfood from people, but his heart is full of worldly things. Only one, who leads a moral life and has a deep insight into the reality of things, can be called a monk. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V268] (DLMBS Commentary V268) At the Buddha's times there were many ascetic orders. Some of them went for almsfood just like the Buddha's monks. After being offered food, some of them would say a few words of blessing; such as "May you be well and happy, may you live long." The Buddha's monks were at first instructed to keep silent. 

    Some followers of the Buddha began to complain about that and wanted to hear some blessing also from the Buddha's monks. The Buddha then instructed his monks to do so, in order to keep lay followers happy. 

    Then some other ascetics, who kept silence after being offered food, said that the Buddha's monks were not true sages (muni) because they did not keep the vow of silence in public (mona). 

    The Buddha reacted with this verse (and the following one, DhP 269).

.. [DLMBSFn-V269] (DLMBS Commentary V269) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 268). 

    Silence does not necessarily mean wisdom. Sometimes one can keep silent only because one has nothing to say, or out of stupidity and not understanding what is going on. One who understands the reality of this world and the next one, who does not cling to anything and has discarded evil, can be truly called a sage.

.. [DLMBSFn-V270] (DLMBS Commentary V270) There was a fisherman named Ariya living in Sāvatthi. Once while he was fishing, the Buddha and some monks went around. Ariya got up and paid his respects to the Buddha, who asked him about his name. When replied, the Buddha spoke this verse, saying that he was not worthy to be called Ariya ("Noble")  if he harmed living beings. 

    Ariya understood and attained the first level of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V271] (DLMBS Commentary V271) There were many monks who were practicing the Dharma. Not all of them had reached the Awakenment quickly. Once a group of monks came to see the Buddha. Some of them had observed the rules perfectly and were very virtuous. Others studied a lot of the Buddha's discourses and yet others were good in meditation. 

    The Buddha asked them if they had attained the Awakenment. They replied that they did not but that it should be easy, since they had achieved so much already. The Buddha replied with this verse (and the following one, DhP 272).

.. [DLMBSFn-V272] (DLMBS Commentary V272) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 271). 

    To attain the Awakenment is not easy. We should not compare it to other tasks. Even if we have attained some spiritual progress, like good concentration of mind, if we have learned a lot of Sutras, or if we are truly moral and spiritual people - in comparison with the ultimate goal these tasks are very easy indeed. Only when we have reached the final goal and eradicated all the taints from our minds, then we can finally be content and say that we have done what had to be done.
