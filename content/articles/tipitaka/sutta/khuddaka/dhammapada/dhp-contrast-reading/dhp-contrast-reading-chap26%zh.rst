.. [MettFn26-02] 〔明法尊者註26-02〕 一位虔誠的婆羅門在聽佛陀說法後，非常的喜悅。以後便每天在家裡供養十六位比丘，他對每位比丘都尊稱他們為阿羅漢。那些未證阿羅漢果的比丘感到很尷尬，便不再到他的家接受供養。他來到精舍向佛陀問原因。僧眾把不敢接受被他稱為阿羅漢的事實告訴佛陀。佛陀說：「你們難道不喜歡他尊稱你們為阿羅漢嗎？」「大德！我們不喜歡。」「諸比丘！這只不過是人們感到喜悅時的表現，表現喜悅並沒有罪過。這位婆羅門對阿羅漢是無限的關愛。因此你們應該截斷欲流，追求阿羅漢境界。」

.. [BudRkFn-v394] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 394) In the time of the Buddha, such ascetic practices as wearing matted hair and garments of hides were considered marks of holiness.

.. [ThaniSFn-V383] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 383) This verse, addressed to a member of the brahman caste, is one of the few in Dhp where the word brahman is used in its ordinary sense, as indicating caste membership, and not in its special Buddhist sense as indicating an arahant.

.. [ThaniSFn-V384] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 384) DhpA: two things = tranquility meditation and insight meditation.

.. [ThaniSFn-V385] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 385) DhpA: This verse refers to a person who has no sense of "I" or "mine," either for the senses ("not-beyond") or their objects ("beyond"). The passage may also refer to the sense of total limitlessness that makes the experience of Unbinding totally ineffable, as reflected in the following conversation (Sn 5.6):
                    ::

                     Upasiva:
                     He who has reached the end:
                      Does he not exist,
                      or is he for eternity free from dis-ease?
                     Please, sage, declare this to me
                      as this phenomenon has been known by you.

                     The Buddha:
                     One who has reached the end has no criterion
                     by which anyone would say that —
                         it doesn't exist for him.
                     When all phenomena are done away with,
                     all means of speaking are done away with as well.

.. [ThaniSFn-V388] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 388) Stains = the impurities listed in note 236. On "consonance," see note 265.

.. [ThaniSFn-V389] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 389) The word "anger" here is added from DhpA, which interprets the "letting loose" as the act of retaliating with anger against one's assailant. Some translators read "brahman" as the subject not only of the second line, but also the first: "A brahman should/would not strike a brahman." However, this reading is unlikely, for a brahman (in this context, an arahant) would not strike anyone at all. If a brahman retaliates with anger to being struck, that is a sign that he is not a true brahman: thus more shame on him for having assumed a status not truly his. On the topic of how to react to violent attack, see MN 21 and MN 145.

.. [ThaniSFn-V390] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 390) "What's endearing & not": In the phrase manaso piyehi, piyehi can be read straight as it is, as "endearing," or as an elided form of apiyehi, "not endearing." The former reading is more straightforward, but given the reference to "harmful-heartedness" in the next line, the latter reading serves to tie the stanza together. It is also consistent with the fact that DhpA takes this verse to be a continuation of 389. Given the way in which kavya cultivated a taste for ambiguities and multiple interpretations, both readings may have been intended.

.. [ThaniSFn-V392] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 392) "Brahman" here is used in its ordinary sense, as indicating caste membership, and not in its special Buddhist sense as indicating an arahant.

.. [ThaniSFn-V393] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 393) "He is a pure one": reading so suci with the Thai edition, a reading supported by the Chinese translation of the Dhp.

.. [ThaniSFn-V394] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 394) In India of the Buddha's day, matted hair, etc., were regarded as visible signs of spiritual status.

.. [ThaniSFn-V396] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 396) "Bho-sayer" — Brahmans addressed others as "bho" as a way of indicating their (the brahmans') superior caste. "If he has anything" (reading sa ce with the Burmese edition) = if he/she lays claim to anything as his/her own.

.. [ThaniSFn-V398] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 398) DhpA: strap = hatred; thong = craving; cord = 62 forms of wrong view (listed in the Brahmajala Suttanta, DN 1); bridle = obsessions (sensuality, becoming, anger, conceit, views, uncertainty, ignorance).

.. [ThaniSFn-V400] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 400) "With no overbearing pride": reading anussadam with the Thai and Burmese editions. "Last-body": see note 352.

.. [ThaniSFn-V402] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 402) "For himself, on his own, his own ending of stress": Three different ways that the one word attano functions in this verse.

.. [ThaniSFn-V411] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 411) According to DhpA, "attachments/homes (alaya)" = cravings. "Knowing": the knowledge of full Awakening.

.. [ThaniSFn-V412] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 412) See note 39.

.. [ThaniSFn-V421] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 421) See note 348.

.. [ThaniSFn-V423] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 423) The forms of mastery listed in this verse correspond to the three knowledges that comprised the Buddha's Awakening: knowledge of previous lives, knowledge of how beings pass away and are reborn in the various levels of being, and knowledge of the ending of the effluents that maintain the process of birth.

.. [VaradoFn-V390] (Ven. Varado V.390) Verse 390: "As desires destructive (hiṃsamano) fade/ So his sorrows melt away": I assume, from the previous line, that 'mano' means 'desire of the mind for what's endearing'. This desire is destructive because of associated attachment. As desire fades, so his sorrows melt away.

.. [VaradoFn-V393_395-396] (Ven. Varado V.393_395-396) Verse 393, 395, 396: The word 'brahman' has various implied meanings, including religiosity, saintliness, godliness, divinity. I use these words interchangeably.

.. [VaradoFn-V396] (Ven. Varado V.396) Verse 396: as in verse 221: "free of all identity" (akiñcanaṃ). PED: having nothing.

.. [DLMBSFn-V383] (DLMBS Commentary V383) A certain Brahmin in Sāvatthi was a follower of the Buddha. Often he invited the monks to his house and he would address them as Arahants. Those monks, who had not yet attained the Arahantship, were embarrassed and many monks started to avoid the Brahmin's house. 

    The Brahmin felt sad and asked the Buddha why so many monks stopped coming to his house. The Buddha then questioned the monks and they told him about the Brahmin's form of address. The Buddha told them that the Brahmin did not mean anything bad; he spoke only out of his respect and devotion to the Arahants. Then the Buddha spoke this verse, saying that monks should uproot the stream of suffering, realize the destruction of conditioned things and experience the Nirvana.

.. [DLMBSFn-V384] (DLMBS Commentary V384) A group of monks once came to see the Buddha. Venerable Sāriputta perceived that those monks were very close to attaining the Arahantship. Therefore he approached the Buddha and asked him a question for the benefit of the monks. He asked, what were the two things that can bring about the disappearance of all bonds. The Buddha replied with this verse, adding that the two things were the tranquility and the insight meditations.

.. [DLMBSFn-V385] (DLMBS Commentary V385) Māra once approached the Buddha and asked him what does the word **pāra** (the other shore) mean. The Buddha knew that it was Māra and replied with this verse, saying that the other shore is the Nirvana, which only the Arahants can reach.

.. [DLMBSFn-V386] (DLMBS Commentary V386) Once a certain Brahmin thought that the Buddha always called his disciples "Brahmins" even though they were not Brahmins by caste. So he went to the Buddha and asked what he meant by "Brahmin". The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that one does not become a Brahmin by birth, but only by long and diligent practice of the Dharma.

.. [DLMBSFn-V387] (DLMBS Commentary V387) The king Pasenadi once came to see the Buddha. He was dressed in royal clothes, with all the regalia. He was very resplendent. In the congregation sat Venerable Kāludāyi, who was in deep meditation and his body was bright, as if emitting light. In the sky, the sun was setting and the moon was just rising, both of them radiating beautiful rays of light. 

    Venerable Ānanda observed all this and then he realized that the splendor of the Buddha is surpassing all others. He mentioned this and the Buddha replied with this verse, saying that the Buddha always shines by the power of morality, virtue, merit, wisdom and righteousness.

.. [DLMBSFn-V388] (DLMBS Commentary V388) Once a certain ascetic came to see the Buddha and asked him, if he (the Brahmin) could also be called "a monk" (**pabbajita**). The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that in order to be called "a monk" one has to discard all evil and impurities of mind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V389] (DLMBS Commentary V389) Venerable Sāriputta was famous for his patience and forbearance. Once a certain Brahmin boasted he would provoke Sāriputta to anger. He came to Sāriputta while he was on his almsround and hit him on his back. Sāriputta did not even turn around but calmly continued on his way. The Brahmin felt very ashamed and begged Sāriputta for pardon. He then invited Sāriputta to his house for almsfood. 

    When the Buddha heard about this, he praised Sāriputta with this verse (and the following one, DhP 390).

.. [DLMBSFn-V390] (DLMBS Commentary V390) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 389). 

    Whenever we are angry, but manage to turn away from the feelings of hatred and wish to hurt the opposite party, then we just won a small victory on the road towards the Awakenment and the appeasement of all suffering.

.. [DLMBSFn-V391] (DLMBS Commentary V391) Pajāpati Gotamī was the Buddha's stepmother. When Māyā, his own mother, died, Gotamī raised the young prince Siddhattha, the future Buddha, herself. Later, when her husband, the Buddha's father, died, she became the first nun and established the Sangha of the nuns (**bhikkhunī**). 

    Because she was the first nun, she was not ordained by the Sangha of the nuns, as was the rule. Therefore some nuns began to say that she was actually not nun at all and started to avoid her. 

    When the Buddha heard about this, he told them that he himself gave Pajāpati Gotamī her ordination and therefore she was a properly ordained nun. He further said, that Pajāpati Gotamī was an Arahant and added this verse to praise her qualities.

.. [DLMBSFn-V392] (DLMBS Commentary V392) Sāriputta and Moggallāna were friends ever since they were born. They grew up in one village, where their parents were Brahmins. Both youths searched for the teaching of Awakenment. They went to various teachers and performed various religious practices, but they were not satisfied. 

    When they were at Rājagaha, the Buddha also came there together with his monks. One of them was Venerable Assaji, one of the first five disciples of the Buddha. Sāriputta met Assaji while the later was on his almsround. Sāriputta was impressed with Assaji's calmness and serenity and asked him who was his teacher and what was his teaching. Assaji spoke a short verse: 

    "The Tathāgata (the Buddha) declared the cause and the cessation of all things that arise from a cause. This is what the Great Ascetic (The Buddha) says." 

    Sāriputta immediately attained the first level of Awakenment. He then went to inform Moggallāna about this and told him the verse. Moggallāna also attained the first stage of Awakenment. Together they went to see the Buddha and became monks. Soon they attained the Arahantship. Later they became the Buddha's chief disciples. 

    Venerable Sāriputta always remembered that it was Assaji who taught him the Dharma and used to pay his respect in the direction, where his teacher was. The other monks misunderstood this and reported to the Buddha that Sāriputta was still worshipping the directions as he had done before as a Brahmin. Sāriputta then explained that he only honored his teacher. The Buddha then spoke this verse, saying that we should always honor the person, who taught us the Dharma in the first place.

.. [DLMBSFn-V393] (DLMBS Commentary V393) A certain Brahmin heard the Buddha to call his disciples "Brahmins". He asked the Buddha if they were truly Brahmins by birth. The Buddha replied that one ought not to be called "a Brahmin" because of birth, lineage or matted hair. Only someone who comprehends the truth and knows the Dharma can be called "a Brahmin".

.. [DLMBSFn-V394] (DLMBS Commentary V394) There was a Brahmin, who climbed a tree near the city of Vesāli. He hanged down from it and told the people to bring him gifts - otherwise the city will suffer. Ignorant people indeed brought him many gifts, because they were superstitious and feared the powers of the Brahmin. 

    When the Buddha heard about it, he spoke this verse, saying that such "Brahmins" could fool only ignorant people.

.. [DLMBSFn-V395] (DLMBS Commentary V395) Sakka, the king of gods, once came to pay homage to the Buddha, with many lesser gods in attendance. At the same time, Kisā Gotamī, using her supernormal powers, flew to the Buddha also in order to pay homage to him. But when she saw Sakka with his entourage, she retreated. 

    Sakka asked the Buddha who she was and the Buddha told him Kisā Gotamī's story (see DhP 114 for the story). Then he spoke this verse, extolling virtues of meditation and ascetic livelihood.

.. [DLMBSFn-V396] (DLMBS Commentary V396) A certain Brahmin once asked Buddha why he called his disciples "Brahmins". Was it then not proper that he should be called "a Brahmin" too, since he was born from Brahmin parents? The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that a true Brahmin is one who overcame all his attachments, not the one who was born from Brahmin parents.

.. [DLMBSFn-V397] (DLMBS Commentary V397) Uggasena married a dancer and became an acrobat (see DhP 348 for the whole story). Once, while practicing on the long bamboo pole, he heard the Buddha's teachings and attained the Arahantship. Then he became a monk. 

    Later some monks questioned his attainment and asked the Buddha. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that Uggasena was truly an Arahant, without any fetters. 
  
    There are ten fetters (*saṃyojana*). They can be divided into two kinds, five so called "lower" or "big" fetters and five "higher" or "small" fetters. 

    The five big fetters are: 

    1) personality belief (*sakkāya-diṭṭhi*), 
    2) skeptical doubt (*vicikicchā*), 
    3) clinging to rules and rituals (*sīlabbata-paramāsa*), 
    4) sensuous craving (*kāma-rāga*), 
    5) ill-will (*vyāpāda*).

    The five small fetters are: 

    1) craving for fine-material existence (*rūpa-rāga*), 
    2) craving for immaterial existence (*arūpa-rāga*), 
    3) conceit (*māna*), 
    4) restlessness (*uddhacca*), 
    5) ignorance (*avijjā*). 

.. [DLMBSFn-V398] (DLMBS Commentary V398) Two men from Sāvatthi owned oxen and they quarreled whose ox was stronger. So they filled a cart with sand and the two oxen tried to pull it. But the cart was so heavy that the oxen were able only to break the ropes and harnesses. The Buddha commented on the story with this verse, saying that we should cut the harnesses and fetters of our mind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V399] (DLMBS Commentary V399) A certain Brahmin's wife was a follower of the Buddha and once she spoke the words in homage to the Buddha while her husband was entertaining some guests. He became very angry and decided to challenge the Buddha. He went to the monastery and asked the Buddha what do we have to kill in order to live peacefully and happily. The Buddha replied that we have to kill anger. The Brahmin immediately became a monk and later became an Arahant. 

    When his brother heard about this, he became furious and went to the monastery in order to abuse the Buddha. Before he got a chance to speak, the Buddha asked him, "If you invite the guests for dinner but they don't eat anything at all - to whom does the food belong?" The Brahmin replied that the food was then his. The Buddha continued, "In the same way, I do not accept your abuse, so it will go back to you." The Brahmin also became a monk and later attained the Arahantship. 

    Later also their two younger brothers came in anger to the Buddha, but also they were converted, became monks and later Arahants. 

    The monks commented how great were the powers of the Buddha, that he was able not only to stop the Brahmins from abuse, but also made them to became monks and Arahants. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that forbearance was the best weapon and power.

.. [DLMBSFn-V400] (DLMBS Commentary V400) Venerable Sāriputta and some monks went for almsfood in Nālaka village, where his family lived. His mother invited him and the monks into her house. But while she was serving them food, she was very rude to Sāriputta and also to the rest of the monks, because she was not happy about him becoming a monk. But Sāriputta borne the scolding patiently and without getting angry. Later the Buddha explained with this verse, that Arahants never loose their temper.

.. [DLMBSFn-V401] (DLMBS Commentary V401) Once some monks were discussing the story of the Arahant nun Uppalavaṇṇā who was raped in the forest (see DhP 69). In this connection they asked the Buddha if Arahants enjoy sensual pleasures or do not. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that the Arahants do not enjoy sensual pleasures, because the do not cling to anything at all.

.. [DLMBSFn-V402] (DLMBS Commentary V402) A servant once escaped his master and became a monk, in due course reaching the Arahantship. Once when he was on an almsround with the Buddha, his former master saw him and tried grabbed him by his robe. But the Buddha explained that the man was not a servant any more, because he already escaped all kinds of enslavement by reaching the Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V403] (DLMBS Commentary V403) The king of gods, Sakka came to pay homage to the Buddha once. At that time, the nun Khema came for the same purpose, using her supernormal powers, flying through the sky. But when she saw Sakka there, she left. Sakka asked the Buddha who this nun was. The Buddha described Khema with this verse, adding that she was foremost amongst the nuns as for wisdom.

.. [DLMBSFn-V404] (DLMBS Commentary V404) A monk named Tissa lived in a cave practicing meditation. In the same cave there lived a spirit who found it difficult to live near somebody of such pure virtue, yet didn't dare to ask Tissa directly to leave. 

    The spirit went to the nearby village and possessed a young boy. He then told the boy's mother that only after the boy is washed with water left over from washing Tissa's feet, would he leave the boy alone. The boy's mother asked Tissa for help and he agreed. 

    The spirit then accused Tissa of exorcism (the practice of which is an offence for Buddhist monks) and on account of this asked him to leave. Tissa reflected on his acts and realized that he did not practice exorcism and had no offence. That gave him assurance and happiness and he attained the Arahantship in that very spot. 

    Tissa continued to dwell in the cave for the whole Rain Retreat and when it was over, he went to see the Buddha. He narrated his encounter with the spirit and other monks asked the Buddha if Tissa was really an Arahant. The Buddha replied with this verse, confirming Tissa's attainment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V405] (DLMBS Commentary V405) One monk went to the forest for meditation practice. He attained the Arahantship and went to the Buddha to offer his gratitude. On the way he passed through a certain village. 

    There a wife quarreled with her husband and ran away. She followed close behind the monk. Her husband saw them and mistakenly thought that the monk is taking his wife away. So he beat the monk and took his wife back home. 

    When the monk returned to the Jetavana monastery, he told his story. Other monks asked him if he was angry. He replied he was not, because he has no anger left in him. The Buddha then confirmed with this verse that the monk has indeed reached the Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V406] (DLMBS Commentary V406) A Brahmin couple once prepared to offer food to the Buddhist monks. The wife sent her husband to the monastery to invite some senior monks. But the Buddha sent four novices (who were also Arahants). The wife was unhappy, did not offer the novices neither seats nor food and sent her husband back. He met Venerable Sāriputta and brought him to their house. When Sāriputta saw the situation, he returned to the monastery. The same thing happened next time, when the Brahmin brought Venerable Moggallāna with him. 

    Sakka, the king of the gods, then took a form of an old Brahmin and came to the house. Husband and wife paid their respects to him and offered him the seat of honor. Sakka refused and paid respects to the four novices. Then he revealed that he was Sakka and the novices were actually Arahants. The Brahmin couple fell very ashamed and immediately served the novices food. 
    When the Buddha heard about this, he spoke this verse, saying that Arahants are not angry toward those, who are hostile.

.. [DLMBSFn-V407] (DLMBS Commentary V407) Two brothers, Mahāpanthaka and Cūḷapanthaka became monks. But whereas Mahāpanthaka soon became an Arahant, Cūḷapanthaka was quite dull and could not make any progress. His brother then suggested that maybe it would be better for him to return to the lay life. 

    The monks thought that he spoke out of anger and asked the Buddha if Arahants still have any anger left in them. The Buddha said that Mahāpanthaka acted as he thought was the best for his brother - there was no anger at all. 
    See also the story for gāthā 25.

.. [DLMBSFn-V408] (DLMBS Commentary V408) There was a monk named Pilinda Vaccha, who always addressed people in a offensive manner, as if he was somewhat superior. Other monks complained to the Buddha about it and he told them that Pilinda Vaccha had been born as a Brahmin for many past existences. Therefore, the way he addressed others was not meant as an offense (for Vaccha was an Arahant), but he did it simply out of force of habit. The Buddha then spoke this verse, saying that Arahants have no intention of harming others even with their speech.

.. [DLMBSFn-V409] (DLMBS Commentary V409) A certain Brahmin once put his clothes beside his house, in order to air it. A monk who happened to pass by mistook it for a thrown away piece of cloth and he took it. The Brahmin accused him of stealing and the monk then returned the cloth back and went to the monastery.

    There he told the story to other monks. The monks started joking about this incident, asking him to describe the quality of the cloth. The monks only replied that he had no attachment to the clothes at all. 

    The Buddha then confirmed that this monk was really an Arahant without attachment and added this verse, saying that Arahants do not take things not given to them.

.. [DLMBSFn-V410] (DLMBS Commentary V410) Venerable Sāriputta once spent a Rain Retreat at a certain village. The people there promised to give the monks all the requisites (robes etc.) at the end of the Retreat. However, when the Rains were over, not everything was received. So Sāriputta told the monks to send the villagers over to him in case they brought the requisites. 

    The monks misunderstood his intentions and told the Buddha that Sāriputta still had attachments to worldly thing like robes. The Buddha explained that Sāriputta's intention was to insure huge merit for the donors and enough of requisites for all the monks.

.. [DLMBSFn-V411] (DLMBS Commentary V411) On one occasion, a similar thing that happened to Venerable Sāriputta in the previous verse (see the commentary for gāthā 410) happened to Venerable Moggallāna. The Buddha then spoke this verse, saying that Moggallāna was free of defilements.

.. [DLMBSFn-V412] (DLMBS Commentary V412) One day the monks complained to the Buddha that a novice named Revata is getting many offerings from the people although he lives alone in the forest. They accused Revata of craving for material gains. The Buddha spoke this verse, saying that Revata has given up all cravings and is an Arahant.

.. [DLMBSFn-V413] (DLMBS Commentary V413) There lived a Brahmin in Sāvatthi called Candābha. In one of his previous lives he made offerings to the stūpa of the Buddha Kassapa. Because of this, a circle of light resembling the moon was radiating from his navel. Therefore he was called Candābha (moonlight). Some Brahmins took advantage of this and allowed people to touch Candābha for money. 

    Once they passed the Jetavana monastery and laughed at some disciples of the Buddha who were on the way to hear the Dharma. Then they took Candābha inside to compete with the Buddha. When Candābha was in the presence of the Buddha, his ring of light went out. Candābha then asked the Buddha to tech him how to make such marks appear and disappear. The Buddha told him to join the Order. 

    So Candābha became a monk and very soon he attained Arahantship and told his followers to go away, since he would no longer go with them around showing his navel. The Buddha then confirmed his attainment with this verse.

.. [DLMBSFn-V414] (DLMBS Commentary V414) A princess named Suppavāsa was pregnant for an unusually long time. She contemplated on the Three Jewels and then sent for the Buddha asking him for help. The Buddha recited, "May Suppavāsa be free from danger, may she give birth to a healthy son." Just as these words were said, Suppavāsa gave birth to a son. 

    When he grew up, he became a monk named Sivali. Very quickly he attaind the Arahantship and was then famous for being able to receive offerings without difficulty. 

    Once some monks asked why was his mother pregnant for such a long time. The Buddha said that in one of his previous life, Sivali was a prince who lost his kingdom and on an advice from his mother he besieged the city of his rival. As a result, the people of that city were hungry for several days. For this deed, Sivali and his mother had to suffer during the pregnancy and delivery.

.. [DLMBSFn-V415] (DLMBS Commentary V415) In Sāvatthi there lived a rich family. They had a son named Sundara Samudda. He became a monk and lived in Rājagaha. His family missed him very much and they rented a courtesan to try to tempt him. 

    She offered food to Sundara Samudda every day. Once she paid some children to play in the street and therefore she invited the monk inside her house, saying that it was too noisy and dusty outside. There she tried to tempt him to give up the life of a monk and become her husband. 

    The monk got very alarmed and realized his mistake. But the Buddha was mindful of this struggle and sent forth his radiance and spoke this verse to Sundara Samudda. The monk attained the Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V416] (DLMBS Commentary V416) This verse has two stories: 

    1) After the passing away of the previous Buddha (Kassapa) a monk went around for donations to build a stūpa. He came to a house, where a goldsmith was quarreling with his wife. The man scolded him and sent him away. Later he realized the wrong he committed and donated gold flowers to the stūpa. 

    In the present life he was a son of a rich woman who had an illicit affair. When he was born, his mother put him away. A young woman adopted him and named him Jaṭila. When he grew up, he married a daughter of a merchant and later discovered a large amount of gold in his house (as a result of donating the golden flowers). He had children and later he became a monk. He soon attained the Arahantship. 

    Later other monks asked him if he was still attached to his gold, to which he replied that he was not. The Buddha then spoke this verse, confirming Jaṭila's Arahantship. 

    2) In Rājagaha there lived a rich man named Jotika. Once he presented the prince Ajātasattu with a great ruby. Ajātasattu, seeing the beauty of his palace and his wealth, vowed to take Jotika's wealth away when he became a king. 

    Later Ajātasattu killed his father and became a king. He tried to break into Jotika's palace and loot it, but he was not successful. He went to ask the Buddha how that was possible, only to find Jotika sitting in the monastery and listening to the Buddha's discourse. Jotika explained that his property couldn't be taken from him against his wish. 

    Later Jotika became a monk and attained the Arahantship. Other monks asked him if he still missed his mansion and he replied that he did not. The Buddha then spoke this verse, confirming Jotika's Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V417] (DLMBS Commentary V417) A dancer named Nāṭa Puttaka once became a monk and attained the Arahantship. One day he and other monks saw another dancer in the streets, practicing his art. They asked Nāṭa Puttaka if he still missed dancing. He replied that he did not. The Buddha then spoke this verse, confirming Nāṭa Puttaka's Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V418] (DLMBS Commentary V418) The story for this verse as identical to the story for the previous one. See DhP 417.

.. [DLMBSFn-V419] (DLMBS Commentary V419) In Rājagaha there lived a Brahmin Vaṅgīsa who had a special knowledge. He would tap on the skull of a dead person and from that he could tell where that person had been reborn. 

    Once he heard that the Buddha also could tell the person's next birth so he came to contest the Buddha. 

    There were skulls of people reborn in hell, as animals, as human, as a god and the skull of an Arahant. Vaṅgīsa knew all of them -- except the last one. He asked the Buddha if he could teach him this skill. The Buddha told him to become a monk and that he will teach him. 

    As a monk, Vaṅgīsa soon attained the Awakenment and did not need this skill any more -- and told his friends that he had reached the Arahantship. The Buddha confirmed his attainment with this verse.

.. [DLMBSFn-V420] (DLMBS Commentary V420) The story for this verse as identical to the story for the previous one. See DhP 419.

.. [DLMBSFn-V421] (DLMBS Commentary V421) A man named Visākha from Sāvatthi heard a discourse of the Buddha and attained the third stage of Awakenment. He asked his wife Dhammadinnā for permission to become a monk. His wife did not accept his property, but instead decided to become a nun. Soon she attained the Arahantship. 

    Once the former husband and wife met and discussed the Dharma. Dhammadinnā would gladly discuss with him everything up to and including the third stage of Awakenment. But she would not talk about the full Arahantship, because, as she said, Visākha has not attained this yet. 

    The Buddha then confirmed with this verse that Dhammadinnā had attained the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V422] (DLMBS Commentary V422) The Kinf Pasenadi and Queen Mallikā once gave alms to the Buddha and Community. The offering was done on a big scale. There was an elephant holding an umbrella over each monk. Because there were many monks, one untrained elephant had to be used. He held an umbrella over Venerable Aṅgulimāla. Everybody was afraid that something would happen; however nothing did. 

    Later, other monks asked Aṅgulimāla if he was scared at that time. He replied that he was not, since he was an Arahant. The Buddha then confirmed Aṅgulimāla's attainment with this verse.

.. [DLMBSFn-V423] (DLMBS Commentary V423) The Buddha once suffered from some illness and asked a layman named Devahita for some water. Devahita was pleased and also sent some molasses. The Buddha had taken a bath and ate the molasses and felt better. 

    Devahita then came to visit the Buddha to ask an offering made to whom gives more benefit. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that the offering made to one who has given up all evil gives the most benefit.
