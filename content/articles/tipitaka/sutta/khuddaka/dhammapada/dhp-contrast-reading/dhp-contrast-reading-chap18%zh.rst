.. [MettFn18-08] 〔明法尊者註18-08〕 有一次，五位在家優婆塞到祇樹給孤獨園去持戒，他們各自守五戒中的一戒，每個人都說自己所守的戒最難做到，最難遵守。因此爭論不休，他們就向佛陀報告他們各自的見解，佛陀說：「所有戒律都難於遵守。」

.. [MettFn18-09] 〔明法尊者註18-09〕 年輕人提舍(Tissadahara)會蔑視他人的善行。他甚至蔑視給孤獨長者和毘舍佉布施給五十萬聖弟子(pañcannaṁ ariyasāvakakoṭīnaṁ)。他更吹噓說，他的親戚都非常富有，像大寺院接受四方來的比丘。有些比丘懷疑，就去調查，結果發現他的親戚都很貧窮，提舍所說的全不實在。

.. [NāradaFn18-01] (Ven. Nārada 18-01) Namely: the Pure Abodes (Suddhāvāsa).

.. [NāradaFn18-02] (Ven. Nārada 18-02) Atidhonacāri = the bhikkhu who lives without reflecting on the necessaries of life. While using the four requisites, namely: robes, food, drink, and lodging, a bhikkhu is expected to reflect on their special usefulness and loathsomeness. If he does not, he transgresses a minor rule by not using them properly. Dhona means the four necessaries.

.. [NāradaFn18-03] (Ven. Nārada 18-03) Mantā mean religious doctrines, arts and sciences. Non-recitation of the scriptures and non-practice of the arts tend to make one forget them.

.. [NāradaFn18-04] (Ven. Nārada 18-04) Ghara is interpreted as householders.

.. [NāradaFn18-05] (Ven. Nārada 18-05) Adhammo is here used in the sense of hatred. The root causes of evil are greed and hatred.

.. [NāradaFn18-06] (Ven. Nārada 18-06) Samādhi, mundane or supramundane concentration.

.. [NāradaFn18-07] (Ven. Nārada 18-07) Kaliü = attabhāva = body.

.. [NāradaFn18-08] (Ven. Nārada 18-08) Kitavā = kitavāya = by means of sham branches etc.

.. [NāradaFn18-09] (Ven. Nārada 18-09) Namely: the Fruit of Arahantship. See note on v. 226.

.. [NāradaFn18-10] (Ven. Nārada 18-10) Outside the Dispensation (sāsana) of the Buddha.

.. [NāradaFn18-11] (Ven. Nārada 18-11) Here samaṇa refers to Saints who have realised the four Paths and four Fruits. They are the Ariya Saints who have attained Nibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn18-12] (Ven. Nārada 18-12) Impediments such as craving, pride, etc.

.. [NāradaFn18-13] (Ven. Nārada 18-13) An epithet of the Buddha. Literally, it means "who thus hath come".

.. [NāradaFn18-14] (Ven. Nārada 18-14) Saṅkhāra means the five aggregates conditioned by causes.

.. [NāradaFn18-15] (Ven. Nārada 18-15) There is no single impediment such as craving, pride, and so on, by means of which the Buddhas regard the conditioned things as eternal.

.. [BudRkFn-v254-255] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (vv. 254-255) Recluse (samana): here used in the special sense of those who have reached the four supramundane stages.

.. [ThaniSFn-V235] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 235) Yama = the god of the underworld. Yama's minions or underlings were believed to appear to a person just prior to the moment of death.

.. [ThaniSFn-V236] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 236) Impurities, blemishes = passion, aversion, delusion, and their various permutations, including envy, miserliness, hypocrisy, and boastfulness.

.. [ThaniSFn-V240] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 240) "One who lives slovenly": As DhpA makes clear, this refers to one who uses the requisites of food, clothing, shelter, and medicine without the wisdom that comes with reflecting on their proper use. The Pali term here is atidhonacarin, a compound built around the word dhona, which means clean or pure. The ati- in the compound could mean "overly," thus yielding, "one overly scrupulous in his behavior," but it can also mean "transgressing," thus, "transgressing against what is clean" = "slovenly." The latter reading fits better with the image of rust as a deficiency in the iron resulting from carelessness.

.. [ThaniSFn-V254-255] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 254-255) "No outside contemplative": No true contemplative, defined as a person who has attained any of the four stages of Awakening, exists outside of the practice of the Buddha's teachings (see note 22). In DN 16, the Buddha is quoted as teaching his final student: "In any doctrine & discipline where the noble eightfold path is not found, no contemplative of the first... second... third... fourth order [stream-winner, once-returner, non-returner, or arahant] is found. But in any doctrine & discipline where the noble eightfold path is found, contemplatives of the first... second... third... fourth order are found. The noble eightfold path is found in this doctrine & discipline, and right here there are contemplatives of the first... second... third... fourth order. Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives. And if the monks dwell rightly, this world will not be empty of arahants." (On the noble eightfold path, see note 191.)

                         On "objectification," see note 195-196.

.. [VaradoFn-V240] (Ven. Varado V.240)  Verse 240: "those who live indulgently" (atidhonacārinaṃ). PTS: indulging too much in the use of the four requisites. 
    
.. [VaradoFn-V254a] (Ven. Varado V.254a) Verse 254a: "off the Path, no saints (samaṇo) do lie". 'Samaṇo' can mean one who has attained one of the four stages of Buddhist sainthood (e.g. see D.2.151). 
    
.. [VaradoFn-V254b] (Ven. Varado V.254b) Verse 254b: "Though people relish Self-perceptions (papañcā), Buddhas have no such conceptions". PED (papañcā): obstacle, illusion, diffuseness. But S.4.202 says “I am” is papañcā (asmīti bhikkhave papañcitametaṃ)

.. [DLMBSFn-V235] (DLMBS Commentary V235) In Sāvathi there lived an old butcher. He was used to eating beef curry every day. Once he put aside some meat to be cooked that day and went for a bath. In the meantime, his wife saw the meat and sold it. Therefore, when the butcher returned home, he realized that there would be no meat that day. He was so angry that he went and cut off the tongue of an ox. He has his wife to prepare it and began to eat. 

    When he tried to take bite of the tongue, he bit off his own tongue. The butcher died in great pain and agony and was reborn in a painful state. 

    The butcher's son was afraid that this evil would befall him as well so he left the city and went to Takkasilā (Taxilā). He became a goldsmith, got married and had children. When he got old, he and his family moved back to Sāvathi. His children were followers of the Buddha but he was not. The children were concerned for their father and so one day they invited the Buddha and monks for a meal. After the meal they told the Buddha that this offering was on behalf of their father. They asked the Buddha to give a discourse to the old man to help him to see the Dharma. 

    The Buddha told the old goldsmith this verse (and the following ones, DhP 236, DhP 237 and DhP 238). At the end for the discourse, the old goldsmith attained the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V236] (DLMBS Commentary V236) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 235) and the following ones (DhP 237, DhP 238). 

    We should strive and make the best effort in order to purify our minds and make the best of our lives. By doing this, we will reach "the place of the Noble Ones", the Nirvana, the complete purification of the mind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V237] (DLMBS Commentary V237) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 235 and DhP 236) and the following one (DhP 238). 
    Although this verse was originally told to an old man, it is actually true for all of us. We all are very close to death, even if we might be still young and healthy. Nobody ever knows the time of his death. Therefore, we all should make our best effort to overcome the defilements of our minds before it is too late.

.. [DLMBSFn-V238] (DLMBS Commentary V238) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 235, DhP 236 and DhP 237). 

    If we strive and exert ourselves, we will purify our minds, attain the Awakenment - and therefore there will be no more birth, sickness, aging and death for us. Then we do not have to fear the death any longer.

.. [DLMBSFn-V239] (DLMBS Commentary V239) Once a brahmin saw a group of monks preparing to enter the city for almsfood. They were rearranging their robes in order to go to the city. The brahmin saw that the robes touched the ground and got wet because of dew. So he cleared that place of grass. The next day he saw that the ground is dirty and it soiled the robes. So he covered the place with sand. During the next few days he saw that when the sun is shining the monks sweat and when it rains, they get wet. Therefore he built a shelter at that place. 

    When it was ready, the brahmin invited the Buddha and monks for an almsfood. He then explained how he performed this good deed gradually. The Buddha replied him with this verse, saying that one should use every little opportunity to perform good deeds and cleanse one's mind of impurities.

.. [DLMBSFn-V240] (DLMBS Commentary V240) A certain monk named Tissa received a beautiful robe and was very happy. He prepared to wear them the next day, but that very night he died. Because he was too attached to the robe, he was born as an insect in it. 

    The monks decided to share his former robe amongst themselves. The insect was very angry and shouted, "They are destroying my robe!" The Buddha heard this and told the monks to leave the robe untouched for seven days. 
    Later the insect died and was reborn in a happy state because of his former good deeds. The Buddha explained to the monks that if they were to use the robe while the insect was stile alive, he would feel hate and anger and would have to be born in miserable existence. The Buddha then told this verse, saying that the monks should not be attached to anything, especially not to their four requisites.

.. [DLMBSFn-V241] (DLMBS Commentary V241) Venerable Sāriputta and Mahā Moggallāna used to deliver discourses in the city of Savatthi. Many people praised them for speaking clearly and eloquently. There was a monk named Lāludāyii who remarked that if he were invited to speak, people would praise him even more. So people invited him to deliver a discourse. But when Lāludāyii got to the platform, he could not open his mouth. So he asked another monk to speak first and that he would speak next. This happened three times. 

    People realized that he was just boasting and laughed at him and reprimanded him. Lāludāyii left in shame. 
    When the Buddha learned about this incident, he spoke this verse, saying that Lāludāyii did not study much and what he did study, he already forgot.

.. [DLMBSFn-V242] (DLMBS Commentary V242) A certain woman committed adultery. Her husband was very ashamed and he avoided his friends and the Buddha. But after some time he came to see the Buddha and told him about his trouble. The Buddha told him this verse (and the following one, DhP 243), saying that all these taints originate from ignorance.

.. [DLMBSFn-V243] (DLMBS Commentary V243) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous one (DhP 242). 

    All the other stains, such as wrong conduct etc. are derived from the main "impurity", ignorance. It is because we are ignorant of the true reality, that we commit these evil deeds. Therefore, only if we destroy our ignorance, can we truly be called "pure". Destruction of ignorance is the main goal of the Buddha's teaching. This is what is called Nirvana.

.. [DLMBSFn-V244] (DLMBS Commentary V244) There was a monk named Cūla Sāri. He was a physician and he often went to see patients. Once he was returning from a patient and he met Venerable Sāriputta. Cūla Sāri told him his patient gave him delicious food as a payment. He offered some food to Sāriputta, who did not say anything and just continued on his way. 

    Later Sāriputta reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha told Cūla Sāri not to practice medicine for personal gain and told him this verse (and the following one, DhP 245).

.. [DLMBSFn-V245] (DLMBS Commentary V245) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 244). 

    One who is always trying to do good things, not to offend anyone, has indeed a difficult life. Always thinking about one's action, always mindful and reflecting on one's deeds, thoughts and words - these are just the basic requirements for such a way of life. 

    On the other hand, if we just do not care about others, if we do not think about how our actions can cause suffering and pain, then the life is very easy. 
    If we want to walk on the Buddha's path we should try our best to lead the difficult kind of life. After all, reflection and mindfulness are a part of meditation.

.. [DLMBSFn-V246] (DLMBS Commentary V246) Not only monks stayed at the Jetavana monastery. Lay followers would also come to stay for a few days, observe precepts and meditate. Once five lay disciples observed one precept each. They all claimed that he was observing the most difficult precept. They argued for a long time and then reported the matter to the Buddha. 

    The Buddha replied them with this verse (and the following ones, DhP 247 and DhP 248), saying that all the precepts are very difficult and all of them are equally important for a good life.

.. [DLMBSFn-V247] (DLMBS Commentary V247) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 246) and the following one (DhP 248). 

    To observe precepts and to lead a moral life is very difficult, but it is a basic step towards the Awakenment. That is why the Buddha says in this verse. If we do not follow them, we "dig out our own roots". That is to say, we postpone entering the way to Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V248] (DLMBS Commentary V248) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses (DhP 246, DhP 247). 

    As it is very difficult to observe the precepts and to lead a moral life, it is also very easy to break them. And it is also very easy to loose self-control. Once we lose it, it is extremely hard to get things back on track and to start our way towards Awakenment again. Therefore we will be suffering for a prolonged period of time.

.. [DLMBSFn-V249] (DLMBS Commentary V249) There was a young novice named Tissa. He always criticized other people's good deeds. He even scolded famous donors like Anātha Pindika and Visākhā. He also boasted that his parents were extremely rich and anybody could come to them and receive many precious gifts. 

    Some monks decided to see if this was true. They went to Tissa's village only to find out that his parents were poor and that Tissa was only boasting. They returned and reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha reprimanded the young novice with this verse (and the following one, DhP 250).

.. [DLMBSFn-V250] (DLMBS Commentary V250) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 249). 

    Discontentment is one of the main roots of a disturbed mind. If we are not happy about what others do, how then can we attain a peace of mind? Discontent with what other monks receive as alms is only one such example. 
    When we destroy such discontentment completely, then we are able to attain a peace of mind and therefore we can concentrate our minds and start on the way towards the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V251] (DLMBS Commentary V251) Once there were five lay followers listening to the Buddha's discourse. One of them was sleeping, the second one was scratching the ground with his hands, the third was shaking a tree and the fourth was looking up at the sky. But the fifth one listened carefully and respectfully. Ānanda saw them and after the discourse was over he asked the Buddha about their behavior. 

    The Buddha explained that the first one was a snake in his previous life therefore he liked to sleep. The second one was a subterranean animal, the third was a monkey and the fourth one was an astrologer. But the fifth one was a learned man; therefore he was able to listen with attention. 

    Ānanda then asked what things prevent people from listening and understanding the Dharma. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying it is passion, hatred, delusion and thirst.

.. [DLMBSFn-V252] (DLMBS Commentary V252) In the town of Bhaddiya there lived a rich man named Mendaka. When the Buddha arrived at Bhaddiya, he realized that Mendaka and his whole family are able to understand the Dharma. He explained the teaching to them and after hearing the Dharma from him, Mendaka, his wife, son, daughter-in-law and servant all attained the first level of Awakenment. Mendaka related how many ascetic teachers spoke ill of the Buddha and tried to dissuade Mendaka from seeing the Buddha. The Buddha explained by this verse, that it is only very natural to see others' faults and not to see one's own. 

    The Buddha then revealed the past existences of Mendaka. He was always a rich man who donated many things to those seeking Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V253] (DLMBS Commentary V253) There was a monk named Ujjhāna Saññi. He was always finding faults with others, very easy to get angry and speaking ill of people. When the Buddha found out, he spoke this verse. He also added that sometimes finding faults with others is good. When we see somebody to misbehave and we try to teach him good ways - that is worthy of praise. But if we do it out of spite and malice, then we won't be able to achieve concentration and therefore we get further and further away from the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V254] (DLMBS Commentary V254) The Buddha passed away in the town of Kusinarā. At that time the ascetic named Subhadda stayed at Kusinarā. He went to many religious teachers but none could satisfy his doubts and Subhadda did not become their pupil. Just before the Buddha died, Subhadda approached him and asked him some questions. The Buddha answered them in this verse (and the following one, DhP 255). Subhadda became a monk and later attained the Awakenment. He was the last direct pupil of the Buddha.

.. [DLMBSFn-V255] (DLMBS Commentary V255) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 254). 

    The Buddhas, Awakened Ones have no "shaking". The meaning of this is that there is no instability, no wavering or unsteadiness of their minds. They have reached the highest Awakenment and their minds are truly firm and steady.
